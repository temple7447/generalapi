     content:`THE salvation of God that would come to all repentant sinners through  Jesus Christ as of grace was, since the days of Moses the prophet, typified by a very significant incident when a serpent of brass was set up for the Israelites.
     The children of Israel were a stubborn people. Because of their faithlessness, in spite of the wonders of the Almighty God they saw in Egypt, they continued to sin. On several occasions while they were journeying to Canaan they provoked God by reason of their abominable deeds, and they were justly punished. But when they repented and turned to God they received mercy.
     One of such occasions was after the death of Aaron when they journeyed from Mount Hor by way of the Red Sea to the land of Edom. And because they grew impatient over the route they began to open their mouths wide I against Heaven. As a result of this God sent dreadful serpents to assail the camp of Israel and I many people were bitten to death.
     Here is the Bible record:
     “And they (the Israelites) journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red Sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way. And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, neither is there any  water; and our soul loatheth this light bread. And the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.”- Numbers 21: 4-6.
     Following this plague the Israelites came to their senses and realised their faults. They went to Moses their leader to confess that they had sinned for speaking against God and against him (Moses). They pleaded with him to pray to the Most High to take away the- serpents from them.
     Moses who was well known for his godly disposition and kind-heartedness and humility, acceded to their request and he interceded on their behalf.
     God heard the prayer of Moses. It was really an easy thing for Him to remove the venomous snakes all at once but He did not. Rather, He commanded Moses, saying, “Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.” – Numbers 21: 8.
     In obedience to the Lord’s instruction, Moses made a serpent of brass and erected it on a pole, “and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.”- Numbers 21: 9.
     
     
     
     All diligent students of the Bible do agree that the whole event which culminated in the erection of the brazen serpent was of great spiritual significance. There is quite a lot to learn from the experience of the Israelites and what God did to relieve them of their pains and to save them from death. Yes, it was Saint Paul who stated: “For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.” – Romans 15: 4.
     Now, let us ask ourselves this question: why was Israel plagued with fiery serpents by the very God of their fathers who had done so much to aid them at the time of their distress and adversity? It is clear from the Bible account that it was because they sinned against God. They were guilty of blasphemy – a very serious offence!
     Today there are people who behave like the faithless Israelites. For every misfortune that befalls them they blame the cause on God.
     When they find themselves in any unfavourable situation they turn round to accuse God-notwithstanding the fact that such a situation is of their own making. There is also the class of those, especially among the intellectuals of the world, who take pride in talking glibly and irreverently about God.
     Men must learn to know that God is not the one responsible for their ills or troubles. The evils or tribulations that often come upon us are either due to our own sins of the devil, taking advantage of our “infirmities being human and especially because of our sensualism, brings them upon us.
     The temptation of Job is a striking example of how the devil can trouble even the man of God with the aim of making the person to curse God and so fallout of His favour. Under such circumstances, the true worshippers of God are required to maintain their integrity in faith as Job himself did, and then cry to God in prayer for help and deliverance. – Job 2: 3; 27: 4, 6; Proverbs 11: 3; James 5: 10,11.
     Salvation
     Speaking in the first person through Isaiah the prophet, God declared: “Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else.” – Isaiah 45: 22.
     In order to fulfil His purpose of saving His people, God had to send His beloved Son, Jesus Christ, to the world not only to serve as a propitiation for the sins of mankind but also to be the Mediator through whom eternal life would be obtained in His glorious Kingdom. – 1 Timothy 2: 4-6; 1 John 2: 1, 2.
     Thus the brazen serpent, which God caused Moses to set up for snake-bitten Jews to look to and which served as a remedy for the plague of poisonous serpents, fore- shadowed Jesus Christ who would in due time be sent to the world  God for all mankind to look to for the healing of their  wounds and for their salvation.
     With this understanding at the back of his mind in regard to his mission on earth, Jesus Christ told Nicodemus concerning himself:
     “And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.”- John 3: 14, 15.
     Jesus Christ further explained the reason why the Heavenly Father has made such a grand arrangement for the benefit of sinful mankind when he said: “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” – John 3: 16.
     We must guard ourselves, by the grace of God, against sin. If the Israelites had not sinned they would not have been plagued. Therefore, sin, which is the transgressing of God’s commandment, is a great danger. “For the wages of sin,” said Saint Paul, “is death: but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”- Romans 6: 23.
     
     Antitypical
     
     It could be recalled that when the brazen serpent was erected on a pole in the days of Moses, the rule was that anyone who was bitten by a serpent would live only on the condition that he looked at the serpent of brass.
     We do know that since the setting up of the brazen serpent was typical, the looking at it was also literal – that is, it was the use of ordinary sight by way of turning the eyes, in the direction of the serpent of brass, of course, with the belief .that by so doing they were carrying out God’s instruction or command. But the case of Jesus Christ being antitypical, we are not expected to see him with our human eyes because he is now invisible being a spirit personality who has been glorified in heaven.
     Then, how do we look to Jesus Christ as to draw a parallel between the typical and antitypical? Christ himself gave the answer when he said, “That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.” (John 3: 15) The key-word in this text is BELIEVETH. In other words what is required is belief or faith in Jesus Christ.
     As a matter of fact, Jesus Christ told Thomas one of his apostles: “Ye believe because you have seen me. Blessed be those who believe though they have never seen me.” (John 20: 29 – Moffatt) What is more, St. Paul stated: “For we walk by “faith, not by sight.” – 2 Corinthians 5: 7.
     So today, the benefits of Christ’s redemption and his salvation are obtainable]e only on the condition that we BELIEVE in him. “He that believeth on the Son (Jesus) hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life: but the wrath of God abideth on him.” John 3: 36.
     However, we must not deceive ourselves in thinking that our mere belief in Jesus Christ while we wallow in sins, indulging in sinful lusts of the eyes and flesh, or when we worship him loosely, will save us. IT WILL NOT. It is when we have IMPLICIT FAITH in and LOVE for him, which will make us keep his commandments unhesitatingly, accept his true doc- trines and abide in the Church organization which preaches his TRUTH unadulteratedly, that we are qualified to claim to have looked to or accepted Christ. – Matthew 7: 21; Luke 6: 46-49; John 14: 15, 21-25; 8: 31-32, 36.
     
     Exalted Jesus
     
     The position of Jesus Christ among the creation of God is unique-it is a position of honour, glory and pre-eminence. We must therefore accept him as our Saviour and exercise implicit faith in him as such.
     Peter the apostle, addressing the council of the Jews, spoke of the greatness of Jesus Christ when he quoted the Hebrew Scriptures which today is called the Old Testament, to wit: “This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.” And he added: “Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.”- Acts 4: 10-12.
     Concerning the exaltation of Jesus Christ, St. Paul also wrote: “Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him (Jesus), and given him a name which is above every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.”- Philippians 2: 9-11.
     Furthermore, St. Paul gave an exhortation to the Hebrew Christians, which, in fact, is directed to every true disciple of Jesus Christ throughout the Christian era. He warned that in running the race of life, we as Christians must put away sin and divest ourselves of the burdens of the world that would impede our spiritual progress. He then admonished, “And let us run with patience the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.”– Hebrews 12: 1,2.
     In the light of the Scripture texts clearly explained in this sermon, we are not left in doubt that our salvation is in our hands. Therefore, “work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.” – Philippians 2: 12.`,

     content:`CHRISTIANITY is so fundamentally based and entrenched on established principles and doctrines that it cannot be blended or mixed with other beliefs without falling into the danger of corruption. This is what many people do not know.

     Interfaith is a mixture of beliefs – that is, people of different faiths coming together in a sort of union to worship.
     Ecumenism
     Today the wind of ecumenism is blowing all over Christendom. There is a strong desire by many church denominations to unite with others notwithstanding their differences in doctrines and forms of worship. For this reason certain churches have relaxed their rules which hitherto strictly forbade their adherents from having any form of communion with others.
     In pursuance of this same objective for church unity, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. Geoffrey Fisher, and his successor, Archbishop Michael Ramsey, had paid visits to both the late Pope John XXIII and Pope Paul VI, respectively, at the Vatican City. As a result of the meeting between Pope Paul and Archbishop Ramsey, 10 Roman Catholic and 11 Anglican theologians met together at Gazzada in Northern Italy, in January, 1967. They made recommendations for joint action on practical ways of removing tension between members of the two churches. A communiqué was issued after the talks which were described as the “first formal steps towards unity between the two churches in more than 400 years”. And the hopes of many people were raised!
     But three days after the talks, Pope Paul stated that Christian unity “still presents grave difficulties, for concept of real unity is not clear to all people.” He was speaking at his weekly blessing of pilgrims in St. Peter’s Square at the Vatican City. He said, “Some people consider that charity – which is certainly necessary – is enough for this unity without adhering to the unique truth of the faith.” (Daily Times, January 17, 1967)
     Catholic Idea
     Obviously, the Roman Catholic idea of church unity is quite different from what others are thinking. While some are reckoning it on terms of equal partners, the other is hoping that it is the coming back of the “separated brethren” to the one fold of the “Mother Church”.
     A Roman Catholic newspaper, the INDEPENDENT, issue of June 25-29, 1968, published at Ibadan, Western State of Nigeria, presented the Roman Catholic view on ecumenism as follows: “The word ECUMENISM is, it must be admitted, a rather difficult term for the ordinary Catholic to fully grasp or understand But we must be clear, first of all, as to what Ecumenism does not mean. It does not mean Eucharistic unity (i.e. we cannot regard the Holy Mass and a non-Catholic Communion Service as equal and interchangeable)..,..It does not mean a whittling down of Catholic doctrines to achieve a common faith with non-Catholics, for that would mean unfaithfulness to the Catholic Church as the ‘pillar and ground of Truth’,” (Italics ours).
     
     In answer to a question, the INDEPENDENT (June 20-27, 1964, page 5) stated: “Catholics ought not to attend non-Catholic religious functions. If they are present at public functions when non-Catholic prayers are said they ought not to answer ‘Amen’.”
     There is every reason to regard all the noise about the unification of all the churches as a show of spiritual ignorance on the part of some and sheer hypocrisy on the side of others. We do not see how a genuine unity can evolve from the attempts being made when nothing is being done to remove the root of bitterness and the cause of the division among them.
     In Amos 3: 3, it is written: “Can two walk together, except they be agreed?” Certainly, they cannot. It is a known fact that great differences in doctrines, church organisation and worship, exist among the churches. These have always been the main cause of controversy. Any union formed by the churches, therefore, with eyes closed upon these facts, is a union of contraries – and it is unchristian.
     Anglican Reply
     The Anglican Communion knows that the Roman Catholic Church does not regard it as an institution founded by God. The proof of this is evident from an Anglican reply to Roman Catholic arguments published in a booklet, the INFALLIBLE FALLACIES. The Anglican priests stated that some people of their parishes were being disturbed by the fact that the Roman Catholics regard them as non- Christians yet to be proselytised or converted and also by the repetition of untruths about their church. They added: “These untruths are part of the Roman Catholic campaign of trying to gain Anglicans for their own Church. Some of the most frequent of them are that ‘Henry VIII founded the Church of England’; that ‘Anglican bishops and priests are not real bishop!; and priests’ and that therefore ‘the sacraments administered in Anglican Churches are invalid!…We do not unchurch them, but they unchurch us. We regard the Pope as the lawful Bishop of Rome and their bishops and priests as properly consecrated and ordained, and their sacraments as valid. But they regard our bishops and priests as either deluded or deliberate impostors, and our sacraments as but imitations or mockeries of the divinely appointed channels of grace.” (Page 4, emphasis ours).
     No serious effort is known to have been made by the Anglican Communion to resolve or clear these GRAVE SPIRITUAL ISSUES before the efforts they are making WITHOUT REGARD FOR THE BIBLE – THE LAW AND GUIDE BOOK OF GOD – to get united with the Roman Catholic Church!
     Importance of Doctrines
     Another evidence of how strongly some people feel about the importance of doctrines in the worship of God was manifested when the Bishop of Rome declared the “bodily assumption of Mary” as an article of faith in 1950. It was reported that “nine British protestants wrote to Pope Pius XII offering to become Roman Catholics if he could produce a scriptural proof of the bodily assumption of the Virgin Mary.” (West African Pilot, October 30, 1950)
     
     So too, when the Swedish Church proposed to ordain women priests, the Church of England protested because it was considered to be scripturally wrong to do so. The then Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. Fisher, sent a “personal and confidential” letter to the Archbishop of Sweden warning that “if Sweden ordains women priests, relations between the two churches will be broken off”. (Daily Sketch, January 15, 1959, published in England.)
     Yes, Dr. Fisher was right, for God has never ordained women to be priests. Even in the church women are commanded not to speak, or teach but “to be under obedience”. – 1 Corinthians 14: 34, 35; 1 Timothy 2: 11-14.
     The point is that all these go to emphasise the awareness of some of the churches about the importance of the doctrines on which the Christian Faith is based. And that was why an Anglican Chaplain, Rev. R. Earnshaw-Smith said that “unification of Protestant Church with the Roman Catholic Church ‘is impossible’, because there existed a number of fundamental doctrinal differences between the Anglican Church and the Roman Catholic Church’ . He added, “There are such things as truth and error.” (Nigerian Daily Express, May 16, 1962.)
     “Credo”
     Only of recent Pope Paul re-affirmed in his “Credo” the belief of the Roman Catholic Church in certain doctrines which have always been the bone of contention between them and others. The Pope stated: “We believe in the infallibility enjoyed by the successor of Peter…We believe that Mary is the mother, who remained ever a virgin…preserved from all the stain of original sin and filled with gift of grace more than all other creatures. We believe that the mysterious presence of the Lord (in the Eucharist) is a true, real and substantial presence…the bread and wine have ceased to exist after the consecration so that it is the adorable body and blood of the Lord Jesus.” (INDEPENDENT, July 21-27, 1968).
     Now there are several church groups that do not believe in the bodily assumption of Mary, her being a virgin forever or the “Mother of God”; they do not believe in purgatory, the celibacy of priests, man-made saints, baptism of infants, the bodily presence of Christ in the bread and wine, or hell being a place of literal fire, and so on. But the Roman Catholic Church believes in all these and some others also believe in some of them.
     The obvious fact is that all cannot be right while they are opposed to one another. So if the claims of the Roman Catholics are true in the sense that they are founded on the authority of the Holy Bible, which all accept as the Guide Book, then others who disagree with them are false, and vice versa. And if some are true and others false, then there is no basis whatsoever for real unity.
     Baptists’ Stand
     The stand of the Baptists is already known. Dr. William R. Tolbert, Jr., President of the Baptist World Alliance and Vice- President of the Republic of Liberia, stated: “Baptists are opposed to any church unity movement which would destroy their basic beliefs.” He added that Baptists “would not associate with any movement to set up a hierarchy to control and influence individual churches.” (African Challenge, No. 196, page 5).
     Here in Nigeria, efforts are also being made towards a “United Church of Nigeria”. The GKS is not a party to it PURELY on doctrinal and other scriptural grounds. And some church leaders of the orthodox groups have asked that their churches should be counted out too. It could be observed that all the obstacles undermining these efforts very well spring from the same variances in doctrines and methods of worship.
     In the October issue of the Spear magazine in 1965. The views of some of the religious leaders were published. Arch- bishop John Aggey of the Roman Catholic Church in Lagos said: “There will be more confusion if the Roman Catholic Church joins the union now because we have certain beliefs different from those of other sects. ”
     In the same issue of the Spear, Colonel John, the head of the Salvation Army in Nigeria, was quoted as saying, “We wish those who are planning to form the Union success. H they think that is the best thing for their churches, God bless them. The Salvation Army is not thinking about joining the Union at this stage because our constitution is different from those of other churches. For example, we have women as Ministers in our church while others don’t…”
     Now the Roman Catholic Church is not prepared to whittle down its doctrines and the Protestant groups also cannot buldge in their beliefs. So any union of all these in the face of the vast differences is but a marriage of convenience to please the world.
     Bible Standard
     There is danger in interfaith because it is an evidence of apostasy or departure from the Way of Life on the part of the true worshippers of God. The Bible standard is that the true Christian Faith must not be violated or compromised.
     Any church group that does not preach the truth faithfully as contained in the Bible is false. ” He that hath my word, let him speak my word FAITHFULLY”, said God, “What is the chaff to the wheat?” – Jeremiah 23: 28.
     Concerning this atomic space age, St. Paul stated: “Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; speaking lies in hypocrisy;…forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats…” – l Timothy 4: 1-3.
     For true Christians to pray together with people of various and wrong beliefs or have fellowship with those preaching the doctrines of devils is INTERFAITH; it is spiritual fornication; it is a sin. – l Corinthians 10: 21. 22; Matthew 6: 24; James 4: 4.
     No Compromise
     Jesus Christ whose example Christians are bound to follow (John 13: 15) did not compromise his faith with those of the Pharisees and other false religionists of his time. , Rather he exposed and condemned their errors and hypocrisy. He said: “… Woe unto  you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men’s bones, and of all uncleanness. Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity…” – Matthew 23: 23-31.
     Today, there are the counterparts of the Pharisees whose stock-in-trade is deceit: and hypocrisy – sometimes coined in a refined term as “religious diplomacy”.
     When the devil was to show up himself where Christ was doing the work of God, he (Jesus) told his disciples: “…For the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me …Arise, let us go hence.” – John 14: 30, 31. Christ did NOT COMPROMISE!
     What is more, St. Paul stated: “DO: NOT UNITE yourselves with unbelievers; they are not fit mates for you. What has righteousness to do with wickedness? Can light consort with darkness? Can Christ agree with Belial, or a believer join hands with an unbeliever?. And therefore, ‘come away and leave them, separate yourselves, says the Lord; do not touch what is unclean (and lie is unclean being an abomination – Proverbs 6: 16-19) Then I will accept you, says the Lord, the Ruler of all being…” – 2 Corinthians 6: 14-18, New English Bible.
     It is on this Christian principle the God’s Kingdom Society stands. Certainly, there is no agreement between light and darkness. Truth and falsehood can never harmonize. So we uphold the banner of truth at all times, and, like Saint Paul, “renounce the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God.” – 2 Corinthians 4: 1, 2
     God from time has been against interfaith and has never tolerated it. The Jews who practised it were severely punished. The instance of Solomon is always remembered by serious worshippers of God. “Did not Solomon King of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did outlandish (unbelieving, strange) women cause to sin.”- Nehemiah 13: 26; 1 Kings 11: 1-14.
     For the details of how the Jews practised interfaith and how they were punished, read Psalm 106: 13-46.
     Peaceful Co-existence
     The GKS, though strongly opposed to interfaith, believes in tolerance and in peaceful co-existence with other religious groups until God’s day of decision when the tares will be destroyed by Him.-Rom. 12:17-21; Matthew 13: 1-9, 36-43.
     
     INTERFAITH IS DANGEROUS. Beware lest you fall a victim and end up in destruction from God. One becomes a victim when one believes in “the doctrines of devils” and unite oneself with those “who are not fit mates” Yes, God says “come away and leave them, separate yourselves”.`,
      title:"THE DANGER OF INTERFAITH"},
 {key:3,
     content:`IT is a vital requirement of the Christian Faith that whoever will be saved must have the accurate knowledge of the truth. This is the will of God. (1 Timothy 2: 3, 4) The claim by anybody that he believes in Jesus Christ and accepts him as his personal Saviour is not enough for salvation unless his belief is grounded on the truth.
     The word truth in the English language means that which conforms to fact and reality, or that which is not false or fictitious. So in this respect one can say the truth of a thing that happens either in the market or elsewhere, or the truth of what one has done, and so on.
     But in the context of the subject of this sermon, the meaning is spiritual and it bears a connotation that is much wider than the ordinary usage.
     In John 1: 17, it is written: “For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.” The inquiring mind would want to know what this truth is.
     When Jesus Christ was addressing the believing Jews during his first advent, he said: “If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.” – John 8: 31, 32.
     That was not all. At the time he was arraigned before Pilate, the Roman governor, he again made reference to the truth. Said he, “My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered, to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.”.. Pilate was rather curious about the claim of it Jesus Christ of having a kingdom, and so he asked: “Art thou a king then?” Instantly, Jesus answered: “Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice”. It was at this juncture Pilate further asked, “What is truth?” – Read John 18: 36-38.
     Whatever was the motive of Pilate in asking the question, it, is all the more interesting to note that it has turned to good in that the very question has been taken up with all sincerity by faithful Christian students of the Bible as a subject for diligent research into the spiritual import of the TRUTH.
     Long before the human existence of Jesus Christ on this earth, it had been prophetically written in the Psalms that “truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven”. – Psalm 85: 11.
     Word of God
     In a nutshell, the TRUTH, for which Jesus Christ came to this world to bear witness, is the WORD OF GOD otherwise known as the “everlasting gospel” or the “gospel of peace”. – Romans 10: 15; Ephesians 6: 15; Revelation 14: 6, 7.
     The Psalmist said that the law of God is the truth and that His word is true from the beginning. (Psalm 119: 142, 151, 160) Jesus himself confirmed that the word of God is the truth. In his prayer to the Heavenly Father on behalf of his disciples, he said: “Sanctify them through thy truth: THY WORD IS TRUTH…And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through thy truth.” – John 17: 17-19.
     It is abundantly clear that without the knowledge of the truth no one can practise the righteousness of God or obtain salvation. It is the truth that purifies as to make. One holy; the truth instils the fear of God in the believer; it gives faith; and it gives sound wisdom and understanding that enables one to distinguish between holy and unholy, or right and wrong.
     The fact that God’s word, the truth, cleanses one from sin was further strengthened by Jesus Christ when he said to his disciples: “Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.” (John 15: 3) And St. Paul described the word of God as water when he wrote- as to how Jesus Christ gave himself, up for the church “that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word”. (Ephesians 5: 26) This is not the literal water used for baptism as some people think but the word of God, the truth.
     Because the truth warns against sin and enjoins people to follow righteousness, anyone who believes in it and translates his belief into action will of necessity put away evil and do that which is good. It is in this way the truth sanctifies or cleanses one. That is the reason why it is written in Psalm 119: 9, to wit: “Wherewithal shall, a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to Thy (God’s) word.” And the Psalmist added: “Thy word have I hid in my heart, that I might not sin against Thee.” (Verse11).
     It is because people disregard the truth and do not pay heed to the word of God that they continue to perpetrate wicked acts. They take pleasure in sin. When they do evil they have no prick of conscience because they are destitute of the truth and consequently, the fear of God which it instils in one and which makes one eschew evil, is not in them.
     Pure Wisdom
     The wisdom which the truth imparts is far superior to any form of worldly knowledge. It is the wisdom from above which James the apostle described as “pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy”. Yes, this wisdom found only in the Bible leads one to salvation. – James. 3: 17; 2 Timothy 3: 14, 15.
     The truth is so forceful that it is able to change the whole character of a man from evil inclinations to godly thoughts and deeds. King David stated: “The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple. The statutes of the Lord are right. rejoicing the heart: the command of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes…More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honey comb. Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward.” Psalm 19: 7-11.
     St. Paul who himself also derived great benefits from his knowledge of the truth, stated: “For the word of God is quick (alive)! and powerful, and sharper than any two edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.” – Hebrews 4: 12.
     It is all these wonderful, divine characteristics of the word of God that makes the Holy Bible, which contains it, the greatest book ever in existence in this world.
     All through history men of high reputation whose sense of spiritual value was not beclouded by devilish philosophies or evil propensities, had always acknowledged the truth of God’s word, its goodness and irresistible force.
     Concerning the Holy Bible, which contains the word of God, Abraham Lincoln had this to say: “In regard to this great book, I have but to say, it is the best gift God has given to men. All the good Saviour gave to the world was communicated through this book. But for it we could not know right from wrong. All things most desirable for man’s welfare, here and hereafter, are to be found portrayed in it.”
     And J. Edgar Hoover, a distinguished U. S. lawyer, said: “The Bible is the unfailing guide which points the way for men to the perfect life. The lessons of charity, justice, and equality which enrich its pages should be learned well by all men in order that greed, avarice, and iniquity can be blotted out.”
     The truth comprises doctrines, judgments, instructions and divine promises. The doctrines are the basis of Christian beliefs; judgments are for the discipline of the believers; the instructions are for the guidance of the Christians in following the path of life; and the promises give hope and comfort to the faithful.
     The Psalmist described the word of God as a lamp to his feet, and a light to his path. (Psalm 119: 105) And King Solomon whose wisdom, as given him by God, was remarkable, stated: “For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life.”- Proverbs 6: 23.
     For the fact that Jesus Christ is the very embodiment of the word of God, and therefore the light-bearer, he declared: “I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.” (John 8: 12) Again, he said: “I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.” – John 14: 6.
     Power of God
     The importance of the truth, which is the gospel of Christ, cannot be over emphasised. St. Paul stated that “it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth…For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith”. – Romans 1: 16, 17.
     To be ignorant of the truth, is to be under spiritual bondage. People in such a state can never know unless the scales of the blindness fall off their eyes, they even claim to be in the light but oppose the truth. The case of Saul, who became an apostle and was known as Paul, is a striking example. When he was professing Judaism-the Jewish religion-be persecuted the Christians but when he was converted and came to the knowledge of the truth, be confessed his ignorance. Said he of himself: “Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.” – 1 Timothy 1: 13.
     Some people take offence when they are told the truth; such ones need prayer so that the devil may leave them. Those who WILFULLY oppose the truth, and persecute those preaching or spreading it are wicked, and God shall destroy them. Jesus Christ told such ones in his days: “And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not. He that is of God heareth God’s words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.” – John 8: 43-47. And St. John said: “He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life: but the wrath of God abideth on him.” – John 3: 36. See also Luke 10: 1,2,8-12, 16; Mark 9: 42.
     Saving Gospel
     It is for the purpose of enlightening the lost sheep of God and giving them freedom from the bondage of Satan in order that they may be saved that Jesus Christ came to preach his saving gospel of truth. Concerning his mission Christ referred to Isaiah’s prophecy which fulfilled on him, to wit: “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised…” – Luke 4: 17-21; see also 2 Timothy 2: 24-26.
     And up till today, the gospel is being preached by those who know the truth in accordance with the command of Jesus Christ. – Matthew 24: 14; 28: 19.
     The truth is very precious. It must not be adulterated by way of adding lie to it and mixing it with vain traditions of men.
     The Bible says “no lie is of the truth”. (1 John 2: 21). Anyone who believes in a lie is damned. Saint Paul made it clear that those who will perish would become victims of Satan’s deceit “because they receive not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: that they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.” – 2 Thessalonians 2: 10-12.
     Today, in our age, some people and/or churches teach traditions of men instead of God’s doctrines in the Bible. It was because the Scribes and Pharisees acted contrary to the truth and followed men’s traditions that Jesus Christ told them: “… Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition. Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, this people draweth nigh unto me (God) with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. – Matthew 15: 1-9.
     It is very important, therefore, that we look well before accepting and believing any teaching or doctrine from anybody no matter his religious claims, or social status, or scholastic achievement. We must be sure that anything we believe has the backing of the Scriptures, as the early Christians of Berea did, otherwise we believe or worship in vain. – Acts 17: 10- 12; see also Galatians 1: 8, 9.
     St. Paul admonished Timothy and said: “Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine: continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thy self, and them that hear thee.”- 1 Timothy 4: 16.
     
     Let us therefore cleave to the truth which is able to make us free from the bondage of Satan, deceits of false prophets, idolatrous commitments, superstitions and all other devices of the devil, so as to be saved by God through Jesus Christ our Lord into His perfect Kingdom of endless peace and happiness.`,
     title:"WHAT IS TRUTH?"},
 {key:4, 
    content:`THAT it is virtually impossible to preach the truth of the gospel of Christ without condemning evil or exposing falsehood is an indisputable fact. Any preaching, therefore, that does not come in conflict with the works of error is not the gospel of Jesus Christ.
    In any issue on which opinions of men differ from one another the reasonable thing to do in order to resolve it is to resort to an authority upon which all can safely rely. If it is a matter in a court of justice and a point of law is involved, a legal authority must be found in order to decide as to which of the divergent views is right. So too if it is a matter about the Christian faith, doctrine or principle, we must depend on the Holy Bible for a solution.
    The mistake many people make is that they are too prone to rush into conclusions on spiritual matters about which personal opinions are of no consequence. They do not care to ascertain as to whether the view they hold is in accord with the Word of God. It was King Solomon who said: “Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths. Be not wise in thine own eyes…” – Proverbs 3:5-7.
    The question as to whether Christians can judge or criticise one another is one of those issues about which people hold different views. Only last week, a friend told a member of the God’s Kingdom Society: “I like the GKS because they are preaching the truth. But they should preach their own without criticising other churches.” That apart, a certain clergyman, having received a copy of The Weekly Sermon, said a similar thing about the GKS but added: “The Bible says, judge not.”
    On this question of criticism or judgment, there is no support in the Scriptures for the view that Christians should not judge or criticise one another. Rather there is abundance of evidence to the contrary.
    The Text
    The text often referred to by our critics is Matthew chapter 7, verse 1, where it is written: “Judge not, that ye be not judged.”
    We agree that Jesus Christ made this statement. But the interpretation some people give to it is very wrong and misleading. Christ himself gave its interpretation in verses 2, 3, 4 and 5, but many people have not the patience to read these verses, let alone understand them. He did not mean that we should not judge or criticise at all. Rather, he meant that before we judge we should make sure that we are in a position to do so in the sense that we ourselves are free from the fault for which we judge others. For if we too are guilty of what we criticise in others, they also will in return point accusing fingers at us.
    In verse 2, Jesus continued: “For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged; and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.” This will happen when the person who judges another is equally guilty in that as he criticises or treats others so too they will do to him, he being not free.
    And in verses 3 and 4, Jesus- Christ threw more light on the point when he further said: “And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?”
    It is possible some may still be in doubt as regards the intention of Christ or misconstrue the whole illustration; so he reprimanded those who always see others’ faults and not theirs, and positively stated what Christians should do, as it is written: “Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother’s eye”
    According to the whole tenor of his illustration there is no justification whatsoever for the conclusion that Christ is against criticism. Contrariwise, it is clear that we can judge others of their errors provided we correct ourselves and put away our own. By this standard a thief is not qualified to criticize another person who steals, and an adulterer is not in a position to judge another person who commits fornication when he himself has not fully repented otherwise he will be regarded as a hypocrite.
    In support of this principle as established by Jesus Christ, St. Paul stated that whoever condemns sin in others and do the very same thing has no defence at all but condemns himself. He declares: “Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judges; for wherein thou judgest another, thou consdemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things” – Romans 2:1.
    Character of Jesus
    When a thing is wrong Christians should have the boldness to say it is wrong; and when they see the truth let them say it and stand by it. This was the character of Jesus Christ when he was on earth.  He criticized the Pharisees and Sadducees for their false claims and exposed their evil practices. When he crossed swords with the Sadducees on the question of resurrection, he told them bluntly: “Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.” – Matthew 22:29.
    On a certain occasion when Jesus censured the Pharisees and they took offence, his disciples asked him: “Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?” Christ answered at once: “Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up, Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.” – Matthew 15:12-14.
    It is because people fear to say the truth or to condemn what they know to be evil that the world is sinking more and more in iniquity. Many religious leaders who claim to be vicars, apostles, bishops, chief imams, and so forth connive at the evil doings of their followers, particularly the nobles among them, because of their tendencies of seeking to please men rather than being faithful to God.
    The tribulation in Nigeria today has been blamed on the excesses of politicians during the civilian regime. But when, among the politicians and others, there were glaring cases of oppression, bribery and corruption, adultery, mischief-making. deliberate falsehood, drunkenness and so on, what did their spiritual leaders do to rebuke their sins or evil deeds and warn them against the danger they were exposing the nation to, and God’s judgment and punishment that could eventually follow? And since trouble erupted it is these same religious leaders who adopted an attitude of dumbness over sin that are now most vocal, in their” usual act of sanctimoniousness, in a frantic bid for prayers. Can God hear our prayers when we have not repented of our sins and are not sober? “Behold, the Lord’s hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot bear; but your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you that he will not hear…” – Isaiah 59: 14.
    However, we trust that the good Lord will for His name’s sake spare this Republic so that His innocent children may have a free course to serve Him in love.
    The stand of the GKS for the truth and righteousness of God is admired by many people, but some envy and oppose her. However, the truth always prevails.
    It was interesting to note, as reported in the New Nigerian of August 24, 1966, that the Anglican Archbishop C. J. Patterson “blamed religious leaders for their studied silence” over the situation in Nigeria. He was further quoted as saying in a circular letter to his fold: “We are the devil by the weakness of our divisions which prevent us from speaking unanimously.”
    We appreciate the Archbishop’s courage for accepting blame but the excuse for their weakness is untenable. The divisions among Christians is no justifiable around for any servant of Christ to refrain from discharging his spiritual functions creditably; Unanimity of speaking is not all that is important but rectitude, forth rightness and truth notwithstanding the voice of dissent.
    Teachings
    We do not condemn personalities or individuals. We do not say that all those in other religious groups are devils, and those in the GKS are holy. What we criticize are the teachings and doings which we have found to be unscriptural and therefore erroneous.
    For instance, some teach and make people believe in purgatory whereas Jesus Christ and his early apostles did not teach any such thing. Purgatory is not found anywhere in the Bible. There are those who teach that the soul can never die; but the Bible shows clearly that the soul can die. – Psalm 89: 48; Ezekiel 18: 4; Matthew 10: 28; Acts 3; 23, etc. Others also command their priests not to marry but the Bible says that “a bishop must be the husband of one wife”. (1 Timothy 3:1,2) Certain church groups baptise infants without scriptural authority. There are a lot more that are taught and done falsely in the name of God.
    A teacher of lies is a great danger to human societies because they lead people at the instance of the devil to destruction. (Isaiah 9:16; Jeremiah 14:14; Matthew 15:14) To say that the lies of bogus preachers should not be pointed out or criticized is contrary to the will of God.  It is a duty incumbent on the true servants of Christ to warn people against false prophets. The encounter of St. Paul with Bar-Jesus, a false prophet, in his days is a case in point. St. Paul called him “the child of the devil” and “an enemy of righteousness” Addressing him St. Paul said: “Wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?” The apostle then cursed him in the name and power of the Lord and the false prophet became blind. And when Sergius Paulus, a ruler, saw all that happened, he believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord”  – Read Acts 13:6-13.
    If Christian must not judge one another, then those who say that the GKS is wrong for criticizing others are equally guilty for judging the GKS.
    However, the truth is that there is no church organization that does not judge others; otherwise there would have been no divisions among them. As reported in a Roman Catholic newspaper, the INDEPENDENT (Sept. 5-12, 1964, page 2) “Protestants of all kinds have strong doctrinal differences from Catholics and their orders are generally not recognized by the Catholic Church”.
    Church history is replete with incidents of atrocities committed against people because of their Christian convictions by those who purported to be the “pillar of truth” in Christendom. Why were people like John Wycliffe, John Huss, Martin Luther and a host of others branded as heretics and some of them condemned to the flames?
    Now, after hundreds of years, the Roman Catholic Church has come out to own its faults. In October 1964, the Vatican Council voted by an overwhelming majority that Roman Catholics should ask pardon from other Christians for their share in bringing about disunity. The text of a draft degree passed by the assembly by 2,076 votes to 92, called for “conversion of heart”. The text said: “All have responsibility in one way for the sins of disunity. Roman Catholics therefore ask for pardon of God and of their brethren…” Daily Times, October 8, 1964, page 7).
    The point we are making is that other religious bodies do judge and some overstepped their bounds to condemn souls to death.  But all the GKS is doing, and that with all sincerity, is that of showing the light so that the people may find the way to Christ. We will never go to the extreme of condemning people to death. God says, “Vengeance is mine” – Romans 12:19.
    Written Judgement
    The preaching of the gospel involves the pronouncing of the written judgements of God in the Bible in condemnation of all that answer to unrighteousness. Jesus said that the words he had spoken would judge men in the last day. – John 12:48.
    How can the words spoken by Christ nearly 2,000 years ago judge men in this last day? Yes, it is through the propagation of the gospel by those he has commissioned through the anointing of the Holy Spirit. Indeed, to pronounce the written judgement of God is the honour of the saints in particular, and it is also the duty of the saints’ companions who are partakers of their grace to rebuke sin. – Psalm 149: 7-9; Romans 10:13-15; 1 John 2:27; 1 Corinthians 6:1-3; Jude 14, 15; 1 Timothy 5:20, 22; 2 Timothy 4:1, 2; Titus 1:4-9; etc.
    Whenever the written judgement is preached, being the truth, it brings to light every false way and has a piercing effect against all on the side of error. St. Paul stated: “But we are sure that the judgement of God is according to truth against them which commit such things.” – Romans 2:2, see also Hebrews 4:12.
    There is always a conflict between truth and falsehood. As light exposes what is hidden in darkness so too the truth uncovers or brings to view lies, hypocrisy and all other hidden things of dishonesty. St. Paul warned the Christians to “have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them”. He added: “But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.” – Ephesians 5:11-13.
    For obvious reasons, evil men and those whose teachings are questionable do not want criticism. They always oppose and persecute those preaching the truth. That was why St. Paul said that they preached “the gospel of God with much contention” – 1 Thessalonians 2:1-4.
    There are certain church leaders who warn their adherents not to listen to the lectures of the GKS, and some even dictate to their followers not to read publications of others. Such is an attitude of those whose doctrines are not true.
    It is those who have something to hide that fear to come to the light. Jesus said: “For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.” – John 3:20, 21.
    Any church organization that is preaching the truth will have no cause to fear judgement. The truth is quick and forceful, and it can withstand any acrid test of criticism, and triumph over everything that rises against it by the power of God. Milton, the English Puritan poet, was right when he stated, “Truth IS as ‘impossible to be soiled by any outward touch as the sunbeam”. Also an erstwhile judge of the Supreme Court of, the United States was once reported as saying, “If a religious belief has substance, it can survive criticism, heated and abusive though it may be, with the aid of truth and reason alone;” And Saint Paul in his characteristic straightforwardness wrote: “For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.” – 2 Corinthians 13: 8.
    Criticisms aimed at correcting errors and reproving evils are necessary for progress. “All Scripture is given by the Inspiration of God” said St. Paul, “and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for Correction, for instruction in righteousness: that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.” – 2 Timothy 3: 16, 17.
    The only thing is that our judgment must not be malicious or based on false premises put constructive and just. Said Jesus Christ: “Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.” – John 7: 24.
    On the whole, it has been established beyond all reasonable doubt that Christians can judge or criticise one another in accordance with the Holy Scriptures.
    
    May God bless those who understand and appreciate the truth of His word when told – whether in the form of correction, reproof or rebuke, criticism or judgment, advice or instruction. Amen.`,

 {key:5, 
    content:`ON the first Sunday of October every year the God’s Kingdom Society commemorates the birth of the Beloved Son of God Almighty, Jesus Christ the Righteous, as FREEDOM DAY. His birth in Bethlehem about 2,000 years ago marked a turning-point in the history of the human race.
Freedom day is not an occasion for riotous merry-making but that for sober reflections on the goodness of God for sending Jesus Christ to this evil world for the spiritual emancipation of His lost sheep. It is an occasion for meditating on the significance of the mission of Christ on earth, and for self-examination as to whether we are living up to the expectation of the Lord.
The celebration is always marked by divine services held in all branches of the GKS, and the President, Brother E. T. Otomewo, usually sends a written message that is read and explained during the services.
The following is the full text of the Freedom Day Message of the President this year:-
Members and Friends,
HAIL JEHOVAH AND JESUS CHRIST!
On this glorious occasion of the commemoration of the auspicious birth of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, the greatest Advocate of freedom who has ever lived on this earth, I send you all my hearty Christian greetings and wish you the Lord’s blessings and protection!
As many of you know, we of the God’s Kingdom Society (GKS) hail the Almighty God whose name is Jehovah, and Jesus Christ, the Redeemer of mankind, because it is They only that can truly save as recorded in Psalm 3:8; Isaiah 45:21,22; John 17: 3; Acts 4:10-12; Revelation 7: 9-17.
Through the frequent criticisms of the GKS and some others, many people are now aware of the fact that Jesus Christ was not born in December but in October. I do not intend to go into details now on this issue. But suffice it to say that there is no authentic history or Bible record which says that Jesus Christ was born on December 25. Even the Roman Catholic Church has agreed with the GKS at last on this matter. A Roman Catholic magazine, The Catholic Voice, had this to say in its issue of July 1962:
“The Gospels do not mention any date for the birth of Christ. We do not know the date of Christ’s birth, not even the year in which He was born. We celebrate the feast of Christ’s birth, on the 25th of December at least in the Western Church. The Eastern Catholic Church celebrates the same feast on the 6th of January. These dates are not based on historical evidences of the exact date of Christ’s birth. The 25th of December was chosen to celebrate Christmas in the third century. . . “ (Page 110)
We shall treat the subject about the date of Christ’s birth in due course and have it published in The Weekly Sermon.
THE GOLDEN RULE
The theme of my message for the Freedom Day this year, 1968, is drawn from the remarkable and famous statement of Jesus Christ at Luke chapter 6, verse 31, to wit: “And As Ye Would That Men Should Do To You, Do Ye Also To Them Likewise.” This has been described as the Golden Rule, which, if followed or observed by men, will certainly bring peace and harmony to the world and thus fulfil to the letter the blessing of “peace and good will” bestowed upon mankind when Jesus Christ was born in: Bethlehem. On that memorable occasion, the angels of heaven chanted in praise of God, saying:
“…Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.” – Read Luke 2: 8-14.
It is clear from what we see among men and in the so-called Christian nations and/or countries of the world that the majority of the people-even among those professing Christianity-do not know Jesus Christ. In other words, they neither understand the teachings of Christ nor his way of life. Indeed, Jesus himself said: “Not everyone that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.” – Matthew 7: 21.
Christianity means more than oral declarations or mere attendance at services on Sundays. It must be practised in the sense of absolute submission to Jesus Christ, the only Mediator between God and men, and keeping his commandments.
Jesus Christ preached the truth of God’s word faithfully, uncompromisingly and fearlessly. He was sincere, humble, kind, forthright and godly. He loved his sheep, and for their sake he laid down his life as a ransom. “Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends,” said he. (John 15: 14).
Hypocrisy
Christ hated hypocrisy and he warned his disciples: “…Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.” (Luke 12: 1) But today we find that hypocrisy has become the common habit of some people who claim to be Christ’s  representatives or followers.
Where there is hypocrisy, the Golden Rule of “do ye also to them as ye would that they should do to you”, becomes meaningless. We have heard of some pastors or religious leaders who, after warning their flocks against adultery, go in the dark or in some secret corners to seduce and commit adultery with the wives of some of their followers. Some of these evil acts, as alleged, take place when the women go to the priests to make confessions, or to receive “holy” communion, or to ask for prayers.
Naturally, any or the priests who indulges in such iniquitous acts, if married, Will not want his wife to be defiled by anyone; yet he has the devilish courage to do to people what he would not want others to do to him!
You as a father will not want your daughter to be beaten up by her husband who is your son-in-law, as some often do, but you mercilessly flog your wife, another man’s daughter, in your home even for petty domestic misunderstandings! Do you, by so doing, observe the Golden Rule as laid down by Jesus Christ? Certainly not!
Your son or daughter or brother or sister just from school with the School Certificate – perhaps with a first division pass – goes to a prospective employer or a personnel manager for employment. He or she passes the interview creditably and proves competent in every respect for the job but he or she would not be employed UNLESS your son or brother offers a bribe of £20, or your daughter or sister gives up herself to be carnally defiled. No doubt, you will not be pleased – and no godly person will ever be pleased – with such an incident. But this is exactly what some people do to others, yet they call themselves Christians!
Guilty Conscience
Moreover, you as an individual will be displeased if someone slanders or back-bites you, yet many Christians so-called slander their fellow Christians. The God’s Kingdom Society has often been made an object of deliberate misrepresentations, slander and reproaches by her detractors who also (profess to be Christians.
The evils done by people are so many that one cannot enumerate all of them especially in an address such as this. Anyone who does what is bad knows in his conscience that he is doing evil; and the guilty conscience has a way of tormenting one. Indeed, John the apostle of Jesus Christ said: “For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things. Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God.”-1 John 3: 20, 21.
Those who do to others what they do not want others to do to them are not fit to hold public offices, and if they claim to be Christians, they are of the type concerning who m Jesus Christ, quoting Isaiah the prophet, said: “This people draw nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.” – Matthew 15: 7, 8.
Yes, all such ones – bogus Christians they are – are a reproach to Jesus Christ and except they repent of their evil deeds they shall lose all their ill-gotten gains and suffer destruction from God in the end, for giving cause for the ungodly to reproach God and His church.- Isaiah 3: 11; Romans 2: 24. 25; Galatians 6: 7. 8.
As earlier stated in this message, God through His angels, blessed mankind with peace and goodwill when Jesus Christ was born. (Luke 2:14) But the fact that the whole world does not enjoy this peace and the nations are hardly of any genuine goodwill towards one another shows clearly that man has gone far away from the path of peace having, like as in the days of Noah before the flood, sunk deep into the ocean of sin. The fact of this is obvious as could be seen in the carnality and godlessness of men the world over.
The speed at which our present generation is running after sin is rising so high that there is cause for fear that it will surpass the sins of Sodom and Gomorrah because of which those cities were utterly wasted. And God warned that the fate of the sinners in Sodom and Gomorrah should serve as an example to those who love sin. – 2 Peter 2: 4-10.
Nevertheless, as God has never left Himself without a witness, there are men and women on earth today who serve Him in truth. They appreciate the fact that Jesus Christ died for their sins. This they know does not mean that they should continue to sin, but that they should deny “ungodliness and worldly lusts” and “Jive soberly, righteously, and godly, in this pre- sent world …” – Titus 2: 11-14.
Charity
Before I conclude, I will not fail to emphasize that the essence of the Golden Rule is bound up in one word – CHARITY. And charity is LOVE. This is the virtue without which no one can successfully translate the Golden Rule into action. The truth of this will be more appreciated if we lay to heart the statement of St. Paul that “he who loves his neighbour has satisfied every claim of the law”. He added: “For the commandments, ‘Thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not covet’, and any other commandment there may be, are all summed up in the one rule, ‘Love your neighbour as yourself.’ Love cannot wrong a neighbour; therefore the whole law is summed up in love.” -Romans 13: 8-10, New English Bible.
Amplifying on the excellence of charity or love over all other gifts, the apostle, in his first letter to the Christians at Corinth, stated: “And though I bestow all my goods  to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing. Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh not evil; rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things…. An now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.” – 1 Corinthians chapter 13.
Truly, if we do unto others what we want them to do to us, there will be “peace, good will” and harmony everywhere in the world.

May God continue to preserve His sheep wherever they are so that they may live to worship Him in love and peace through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen`,

Conflicting views have been expressed by people about heaven. Some people believe and teach that it is a place where all good men, women and even children go after death to enjoy everlasting bliss.
Religious racketeers have used their trumped up ideas of heaven to play on the ignorance of people, taking money from them with the promise and hope that whatever they spend for the church is being used in heaven to prepare a place for them. Sometimes fictitious stories of certain people carried in the arms of angels to heaven are told the flock from the pulpit with a view to making the sermons interesting as well as boosting up the economy of the church. For this same purpose the parable of Jesus Christ about Lazarus and the rich man has been given a twist and interpreted literally as if poverty is the passport to heaven. But priests are making themselves rich on earth!
In a religious magazine, THE PRAIRIE OVERCOMER, issue of January 1953, published monthly by Prairie Bible Institute, Alberta, Canada, the story of a “woman who saw heaven” was reported. The woman, as reported, “died at three o’ clock” and “her family, in accordance with Chinese custom, had immediately prepared her body for burial”. At about sunset a noise was heard in the death chamber, the report went on, and the woman was found awake sitting erect and having removed her grave clothes and put on those she had been wearing before her death. She was then quoted as saying:
“I remember seeing all the family around me crying. Then the Lord Jesus came into the room and took me by the hand and said, ‘Come with Me.’ In a short time we were before a gate of pearl. It was the gate of Heaven. Angels opened it and we went in. I saw many beautiful houses all of pretty colours…”
The report says that “people flocked in from miles around to hear the wonderful story” and “they could not reject her testimony”
We must point out that this story of the woman cannot be reconciled with the teachings of Jesus Christ whom she said took her by the hand and, therefore, the story is most unacceptable. A demon in a pretended appearance of Jesus Christ and others in the guise of angels might have appeared to her, and from her own account it is clear that she was, according to the Scriptures, a victim of evil spirits – demons. – 2 Corinthians 11: 14, 15; 1 John 4: 1; Revelation 16: 13, 14.
Ignorance
It is certain teachings of some of the churches which have neither the backing of the Scriptures nor of sound reason, that have turned some people to be agnostics and atheists believing not in God or heaven or other sacred truths. But some atheists and agnostics – the reasonable and humble ones – have become Christians after discussions, which were devoid of prejudice, with Christian leaders who preach the truth. However, we know, too, that some do not believe Christian doctrines because of their arrogance and spiritual ignorance (John 9: 39-41); and some others being devils incarnate never appreciate or understand the truth of God but always oppose it. – Psalm 10: 4, 5; Daniel 12: 10; 1 Corinthians 2: 14; 2 Corinthians 4: 3, 4.
On the other hand, there are people who argue that heaven is not a place and that it cannot be located but that it is a state or condition. They hold the view that when a person is living well in comfort, and enjoying the good things of life, he is in heaven.
A certain Englishman in Lagos who claimed to be a Christian once had a discussion with one of the ministers of the GKS about heaven. His idea of heaven was that it is a state of good living in this world, and argued that no one could point as to which direction heaven is. However, at the end of the discussion, which took place in his house on his request, he honestly confessed his ignorance of the Bible.
Under the heading of “heaven and hell”, the Illustrated World Encyclopedia has this to say: “Heaven is the name for the p1ace where good persons are rewarded after they die…People may usually think of heaven as being ‘in the sky’ and hell ‘below the earth’, but in the Christian re1igion there is no exact place where heaven or hell is known or supposed to be.” (Vol. 11, page 2539) This view which many hold is grossly erroneous.
Theologians
Even now some who claim to be theologians are doubting the existence of heaven. In the atlantic edition of the TIME magazine issue of May 19, 1967, it was reported that “many theologians are now attempting to redefine heaven and hell in this-worldly terms- not as places where humans survive after death, but as states of mind and modes of being that begin here on earth.” The magazine then quoted Notre Dame’s Jesuit Biblical Scholar, John Mc- Kenzie, as saying, “The traditional views of heaven and hell are about 95% mythology.”
Earlier in the issue of March 31, 1967, the TIME had reported that heaven and hell were shrugged off as myth by Dominican Theologian Willem van der Marck. He was quoted as saying, “Heaven and hell just do not preoccupy us any more:”
Here in Nigeria there are also many people who do not believe that there is heaven. In the DRUM magazine, issue of December 1966 the views of some Nigerians about God were published. One of those interviewed was reported to said: “I do not believe that is God who sits in to heaven watch what we do. Neither do believe that there is a place like heaven…
It is rather amusing to go through this cross-section of views of sceptical men most of which smack of crass spiritual ignorance or delusion.
We do know that God’s knowledge is infinite – that is, it has no end. But the human intellect has a limit, and so spiritual matters or things that are beyond that limit can never be comprehended by men – no matter how highly developed their reasoning faculty may be. This is the cause of the difficulties of people over spiritual matters. Said St. Paul: “…We speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom teacheth; but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; for they are foolishness unto him; neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.” – 1 Corinthians 2:13, 14.
Moreover, unless a person has pleasure in the word of God and allows himself to be used by Him through His Spirit as to be able to compare spiritual things with spiritual, he cannot understand His works. The Psalmist declared: “The works of the Lord are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.” – Psalm 111: 2.
Men have developed a tendency of discarding or disbelieving what they have not the capacity to understand. Concerning God and His works, it is such things as are revealed that we as human beings – imperfect mortals – can know. It was Moses the prophet who said: “The secret things belong unto the Lord our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.” – Deuteronomy 29: 29.
Unquestionable Truth
That heaven is a place is an unquestionable truth revealed in the Holy Bible. Where it is, is so clearly shown in the Bible that even a child with little training can point to its direction. It is not a state of the mind or a condition of living. The Bible account of the creation gives a vivid picture of what and where heaven is.
In Genesis chapter 1, verse 1, it is written: “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth,” The earth was void, there was no form of life, and it was covered with waters. There was darkness all over the earth until light was created. After that, the firmament was also created. “And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament and it was so. And God called the firmament Heaven.” – Genesis I: 6-8.
The account further states of how the sun, moon and stars were created and placed in the expanse of heaven. “And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also, And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth.” – Genesis I: 16, 17.
In the face of the foregoing glaring biblical record, it will be unreasonable not to think of heaven as a place or to pretend not to know its location. We standing on this earth cannot point downwards when we talk of the firmament or where the sun, moon and stars are: we must look or point skywards or upwards.
The word heaven is defined as high or lofty. Thus the cloudy region of the air where birds fly is spoken of as heaven. It is stated that God created “fowls that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.” (Genesis I:20) And Elihu in the book of Job spoke of the birds as “the fowls of heaven.” (Job 35 : 11).
There is, above the firmament, a vast open space where other planets, the sun, moon and stars. are. And yet above all that there is the heaven where the Almighty God dwells. In the Psalms it is written: “The heaven, even the heavens, are the Lord’s: but the earth hath he given to the children of men.” “The Lord is in his holy temple, the Lord’s throne IS IN HEAVEN: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.” (Ps.115: 16; 11: 4). Heaven is again clearly shown here to be a place; not a state or condition of one’s living.
The prophet Isaiah wrote: “Thus saith the Lord, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool…” (Isaiah 66: 1; Acts 7: 47-50.) And in the Lord’s Prayer, we say: ‘,Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name” (Matthew: 6 : 9) Jesus Christ teaches us by this that our gracious Spirit Father is in a place called heaven.
Heaven of heavens
The Bible shows that there are several heavens but the heaven where God dwells is the highest and is known as “the heaven of heavens”. (Deuteronomy 10: 14; 1 Kings 8:27; 2 Chronicles 2:6) Also, innumerable angels are there. These are spirit creatures who in intelligence, power and in every other respect, are far superior to human beings. (Psalm 8: 3-5; 103: 20; Hebrew 12: 22,23) It was from heaven Jesus Christ came to this earth, and he said: “For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.”
Indeed, that heaven is a place and is above is therefore beyond argument. Jesus Christ ascended to heaven in the presence of his apostles after he had spoken to them. The Bible states that while they looked at him. “he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight. And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men (angels of God) stood by them in white apparel…” The angels told them that “Jesus is taken up from you into heaven” – Acts 1: 9-11. And St. Paul confirmed that Jesus Christ “ascended up far above all heavens” – that is, the highest heaven or heaven of heavens.-  Ephesians 4: 10: Hebrews 4: 14; 8: 1, etc.
From all the references of the Bible already explained, it is erroneous to hold the view that heaven does not exist or that it cannot be located. But the question as to who will go to heaven is another subject that will be treated in due course. However, we must point out that the teaching that all good persons go to heaven when they die is without foundation in the Scriptures. If all the good will go to heaven, why did the Psalmist and Jesus Christ say that “the meek shall inherit the earth”? So too the belief that Mary went to heaven with the human body is a figment of imagination.
If Christian teachers confine themselves to teaching what God says in the Bible, people will not be as ignorant of the Scriptures as they are today. They put aside the Bible and teach fables to misguide innocent people.
The view that there are seven heavens cannot be substantiated with the Scriptures. The Bible gives the idea of three heavens. St. Paul in his second epistle to the Corinthians wrote about the visions and revelations of the Lord, saying, “I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the THIRD HEAVEN.” – 2 Corinthians 12: 1,2.
It is very important that we believe that there is heaven where God Almighty dwells and from where we should expect protection and blessing particularly in this atomic age. Where we do not, then we are no Christians and have no protection or hope of salvation. It was James the apostle who stated: “Do not err, my beloved brethren. Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above (Heaven), and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.” – James 1: 16, 17.
Yes, heaven is a place and it is there God in His Kingdom dwells!`,

    content:`ALL over the world evidences of moral degeneration abound. Sexual immorality has posed a problem to which no human answer has been found.
    The more people condemn acts of immorality, the greater the vigour with which majority indulge in them. Men and women who are notorious for their characteristic deviation from the path of virtue are sometimes accorded places of honour.
    Some people are sometimes moved to ask whether God, in fact, laid down any code to guide the conduct of men; and if He did, why men are not keeping to that code of conduct and what God’s attitude towards these things is.
    The Creator, no doubt, had a purpose for bringing man into existence. “This people have I formed for myself,” said He “they shall shew forth my praise.”  – Isaiah 43: 21; see also Psalm 100: 3-5; 79: 13; Revelation 4:11; 14:6,7.
    Ten Commandments
    In order that man may fulfil God’s purpose and prove worthy of his honour, he is required to live up to certain standards of behaviour both in the service or his Creator and in his dealings with his fellow men. To this end God enacted laws to guide His people. Among the laws given in the days of Moses the prophet, the Ten Commandments as written in Exodus chapter 20, were of fundamental significance.
    Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ came and confirmed them but” with modification of grace summing up all of them under LOVE – the love of God and that of one’s neighbour. (Mark 12: 28-31; Romans 13: 10) It is on this royal law or golden rule the principles of Christianity are based. To live up to these principles is to build up a strong moral character that goes with true honour and abiding grace; it is to lead a life of holiness that brings glory and life eternal. But to do otherwise is certainly disastrous.
    It is because people set aside the principles of God and go about following the lusts and devices of their own hearts that crimes and calamities ravage the modern race; that sex perversion becomes the order of the day; and there continues to be deterioration in moral and spiritual values.
    SIN, in one word, is the bane of humanity. It robs man of his honour and glory, and even deprives him of the right to existence.
    Adultery is a sin. And King Solomon said: “But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: be that doeth it destroyeth his own soul. A wound and dishonour shall he get; add his reproach shall not be wiped away.” – Proverbs 6: 32,33.
    Yes, ADULTERY is one of the sins of the people for which God is going to destroy this evil world. (Hosea 4: 1-3; Isaiah 26: 21) So too fornication is an abomination. The apostles of Christ jointly commanded the believers through the Holy Spirit to ABSTAIN FROM FORNICATION and other heathenish practices. (Acts 15: 28, 29) Moreover, it is positively stated in the Bible that NO ADULTERER, ADULTERESS OR FORNICATOR WILL INHERIT GOD’S KINGDOM. – 1 Corinthians 6: 9, 10, 18; Galatians 5: 19-21; Ephesians 5: 3-6.
    Today, adultery and fornication are among those things in which the world takes greater pleasure. This shows how men have gone far away from God and His word.
    Church Leaders
    Certain religious leaders have been found guilty of immorality. It was reported in the front page of the Nigerian Daily  Express of 10th  April, 1961, that “a woman told a Church court in London that she committed adultery 75 to 80 times with a vicar” If the vicar of a Church can be so immoral, what is he expected to say or do when his followers do the same? Practically nothing! – Romans 2:1, 2, 22-27.
    Some Church leaders connive at the immoral behaviours and practices of the members of their organisations because they fear that if they speak out they would lose adherents. Certain male and female members of a church parish were often found after church services making love in a hotel near their place of worship. And when someone called the attention of the pastor in charge to the unwholesome conduct of the members and protested, he received to his chagrin a sharp rebuke from the priest. “Are you the one sent by God to condemn people? or do you want to scatter my Church?” the pastor inveighed. And he added: “The Bible says judge not but let both good and bad grow together till the time of the harvest.”
    This is the way certain preachers quote the Bible like the devil and wrest its passages to suit their own purposes only to deceive the gullible. And with such an irrational attitude and negative approach to matters of this nature which is but a manifestation of lack of spiritual understanding, such priests also contribute to the moral decay prevalent among the folds of many Churches so-called.
    Of a truth, many Church leaders do not in the least have the spiritual dynamism nor reflect the irresistible, awe-striking force of the word of God dreaded by evil-doers nor the reformatory power for which Christianity is renowned.
    There is nothing wrong in judging anyone who acts contrary to the law of God. The elders in the Church are charged with the responsibility not only to judge or rebuke offenders but also to punish them by way of excommunication where they do not repent. This must be done without fear or favour regardless of the social rank or status of the unrepentant sinner.
    When there were reported cases of fornication among the Christians at Corinth, so much that one had union with his father’s wife, St Paul gave stern orders through his epistle that such a person should be judged and expelled from the Church-more so, when there was no evidence of contrition in that person. (1 Corinthians 5: 1-5, 9-13) Such disciplinary measures serve as a deterent to others who may be carried away into similar abuses. What is more, St. Paul also enjoined Timothy, his fellow labourer in the gospel, saying, “Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.” – 1 Timothy 5: 20
    “Civilization”
    What the world has been pleased to call “civilization” is fraught with a number of evil things that sap the moral and spiritual strength of any nation. Here in Nigeria we are witnesses of how it has contributed to lower the moral standard of the present generation.
    We now find ourselves in a world where uprightness of character counts but little, where men and women of proved integrity and rectitude are not as popular as those of corrupt and dissolute disposition. The newspapers and magazines are always there to give prominence to loose women who for material gain and vainglory sell away their feminine honours. The TV programmes are considered to be exciting when they have to do with naked women, love affairs, and other sensual acts.
    For these newspapers and magazines pornographic publications are the spring-board to their social popularity, and indecent advertisements of naked women are their source of more income and economic stability. But it must be made clear that any medium of information that encourages sexual immorality in any way is not only acting contrary to the law of God but is also doing great disservice to humanity.
    The way the devil is using men and women and even children these days is so bad that many sober people are becoming more concerned about where the present generation is heading for.
    There are clubs and theatres where people go simply to engage in sinful, immoral pleasures. Worldly women make obscene appearance on the stage and are greeted with cheers, and those of them who go besides themselves to strip clothes off their, bodies and wriggle themselves dancing in a most indecent manner are given the loudest applause. And you find some who call themselves Christians among them too!
    The other day, the Sunday Times (February 11, 1968, page 3) published its investigation on the question of “sex and the single girl”. The view was expressed that “hardly will you find one out of thirty who is still a virgin”. It was further stated: “Even our men would look down on such girls… They regard these virgins as immature and unsophisticated.” It was also the opinion of some that “chastity is out of date” and “is not fashionable”. These views and others were gathered from Nigerian girls among whom were graduates, clerks, and so on.
    It must be pointed out that men who look down on a girl for being a virgin are themselves depraved characters. And any girl who seeks to please such men by leading a loose life so as to appear sophisticated, modern and fashionable, is stupid and spiritually not better than a beast. SHE SHALL PAY DEARLY FOR HER PERVERSION. – Look up Psalm 49: 12; Proverbs 11: 3; 21: 15,16; 2 Corinthians 5: 10.
    The Sunday Times investigation is but a confirmation of the well known fact that immorality has eaten deep into the fabric of the Nigerian society – even to the extent that the true sense of value of the majority of youths has been contaminated.
    Young girls take extraordinary pride in their age, they abuse their youth forgetting that youth is but a temporal state. In their exuberance they shift from fashion to fashion and adopt all sorts of mannerism – winking of eyes and body movements – all to attract attention of those of the opposite sex. Today mini-skirt is the vogue. They have learned, in Peter Howard’s description, to wear wigs for the delight of men, to paint lips, cheeks, finger-nails, toes, eyes till they are like the colours of a mandrill’s backside. In all these that make for immodesty certain women, some above middle age, would want to compete (godlessly) with the younger generation!
    These things are not good. Mini-skirts should be banned by the Government. Church leaders who are worth their salt must speak out not only in condemnation of vices but also in scattering evils as of a duty but within the limit of their prerogatives as prescribed in the Holy Bible. Governments as well must discourage immoral tendencies in their institutions and departments and take steps to check immorality in the general public. This is of vital importance to the spiritual and moral strength of any nation.
    Some blame the cause of the low morals of youths on parents. It cannot be argued that some parents are not reprehensible. There is an element of truth in the saying that parental delinquency begets youthful delinquency. But there are also instances of children who have perverted to loose life though they were brought up in strict discipline under parents of known integrity, strong character and high morals. Such parents are not to blame but the children who will definitely give account of themselves to God.
    It was King Solomon who said, “Rejoice, O young man (or young woman), in thy youth.; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days’ of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment. Therefore…put away evil from thy flesh: for childhood and youth are vanity.”- Ecclesiastes 11: 9,10.
    Social Evils
    Today a lot of things known to be bad and contrary to morality are done by people without feeling remorse. The sin of fornication and even adultery are taken lightly. There are places where prostitution is legalised and permitted. Married women have the gut to keep boyfriends and are not ashamed to confess having lawless sex relations with other men. Some men on the other hand also boast of the number of girls they have defiled or of women they have succeeded to seduce from their husbands. We pity them. And may God give them repentance – for UNLESS they repent to His satisfaction, they shall get full reward for their heinous sins. – 1 Timothy 1: 9, 10; Hebrews 13: 4; Revelation 21: 7, 8.
    Social gatherings and youth clubs have become fertile grounds for immorality. Some schools also contribute to the moral laxity among the youths. Take for example, the case of male students of a college inviting the students of a Girls’ Grammar School to a week-end or end-of-term dance at the college hall with the approval of the respective principals. The pity of it is that some of such schools are run by certain so-called church denominations!
    With such low moral and spiritual standards in institutions of learning, apart from the secular and materialistic ideas pumped into the students by godless tutors, we agree with the view that a boy or girl finds the school environment a battle-ground rather than a training ground.
    Unrestricted social intercourse between boys and girls not only makes them sex lawlessly and contact diseases but also results in some school girls becoming pregnant and therefore unable to complete their training courses: and others because of shame resort to procuring abortion but die in the process.
    These are some of the evils in human societies that must be condemned without reservation. The Christian boy or girl must resist these temptations and keep himself or herself pure in the fear of God knowing very well that God’s judgment awaits everyone. Evildoers must be brought to face the grim realities of the consequences of their actions.
    Last Days
    It had long been foretold in the Scriptures that evil practices would be rampant among men in this final age of the world. St. Paul described the last days as a time of troubles, and stated that men would be selfish, covetous, blasphemous, unholy, with no respect for parents, wanting in self-control, swollen with self-importance, high-minded and “lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God”. – 2 Timothy 3: 1-5.
    The apostle further stated that those who would endeavour to live a godly life as Christians would be subjected to persecution, whereas “evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived”. – 2 Timothy 3: 12, 13.
    But one thing is clear: it is that God will not continue to tolerate the sins of men indefinitely, iniquity shall have an end.
    God’s Vengeance
    It was the wickedness of men on earth when every imagination of the thoughts of their hearts was evil continually, that provoked the wrath of God and caused the Deluge which destroyed the ungodly in the days of Noah. He (Noah) was found righteous and was saved with his family. – Genesis 6: 5-8; 7: 1-10, 21-24; 2 Peter 2:4,5.
    There is also the instance of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah because of the sins of the inhabitants. Immorality reached such a height that men, burning with lust for one another, committed sodomy-the sin of carnal relation between male persons. When those cities were destroyed Lot, who neither took part nor had pleasure in the sins of the people, was rescued by God through His angels. – 2 Peter 2: 6-10.
    Very soon God will rid the world of all unrighteousness. It is sheer wishful thinking for anybody to hope that he could escape God’s wrath and punishment when he or she does not repent thoroughly of his or her sins. “For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that everyone may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.” – 2 Corinthians 5: 10.
    The severity with which God dealt with those who were guilty of immorality in the days of old is an object lesson to Christians of today, warning them to refrain from sinful lusts. (1 Corinthians 10: 5-11; Romans 11: 20-22) It is because of this understanding that the GKS is firm in the enforcement of discipline expelling from the fold (after ecclesiastical judgment) unrepentant members and even ministers who are guilty of ungodly acts. – Proverbs 11: 31; 1 Corinthians 5: 11-13; 1 Peter 4: 17, 18.
    In a comprehensive admonition to the Church of the Thessalonians, St. Paul stated what every Christian should do for the maintenance of self-respect and dignity in the Lord. As it is written: “This is the will of God, that you should be holy: you must abstain from fornication: each one of you must learn to gain mastery over his body, to hallow and honour it, not giving way to lust like the pagans who are ignorant of God.”– 1 Thessalonians 4: 3-5, New English Bible.
    From the foregoing it is abundantly clear that God is against immorality.`, 
    title:"GOD AND MORALS (1)"},
 {key:8, 
    content:`“THE pleasures of sin” are only but for a short time and yet their aftermath is misery and vexation of spirit.
    For the carnal man or woman all that life means to him or her is sex, drinks, dance and such like. He or she therefore indulges in these things quite in excess Contrary to the laws of God. Among the people who have developed such an attitude towards life you find those who say, “Let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die.” When some of them have spent all their savings and consumed all their substance in sinful pleasure but do not die ‘tomorrow,’ they become wretched. And worse still, some will turn round to accuse God for being responsible for their sensualism and miserable state.
    St. Paul showed clearly that people who say, “Let us eat and drink’ for tomorrow we die”, are purposeless and without hope of the life in the world to come. (1 Corinthians 15: 32-34; Isaiah 22: 13, 14) people of such Worldly character, except they repent, can never be true worshipers of God. And if they claim to be Christians, they are not the serious type – and with many of them, going to church services is just pastime. This is true, and we say it without fear.
    Men must realise that unless they lead a life that is pleasing to their Creator, the Almighty God, they gain nothing.  Such a life must be one of high morals and integrity. King Solomon stated: “The integrity of the upright shall guide them: but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them.” – Proverbs 11: 2.
    Civilised Countries
    It is commonly said that the influence of Western civilization is mostly responsible for the high rate of juvenile delinquency and immorality among adults now prevalence in African Countries. In fact, many beautiful aspects of our culture and customs, which make for decency, are now being violated in the name of civilisation, and are really giving way to the modern orgies.
    There is no doubt that, by worldly standards, the countries in Europe and America have developed greatly; but it will be a silly mistake for us to look to those countries for spiritual and moral values. Things are worse there. Honest Europeans and Americans say this too. Let us look to the word of God – the Holy Bible – for guidance.
    In the more civilised countries morality has declined so much that beastly habits are exhibited in the open without shame. Only of recent LIFE magazine (April, 1968) carried a report of how a retired French colonel was provoked by an increasingly common sight in Paris – “huge advertisements on subway station walls showing voluptuous maidens in various stages of undress”. The report added: “The erotic content of French advertising has escalated rapidly of late as if to catch up with art, movies and literature. There are ads showing girls wearing only their nylons, girls wearing only their bras, nude girls, nude men, semi nude girls with nude men and now – voila  –  nude couples.”
    In the United States things have got quite out of hand and the situation is appalling. It was reported that “there were some 275,700 illicit births in 1964″. The figures of illegitimacy keep going up despite the campaign to inspire interest in birth control. “A constantly startling fact pointing to degeneracy of these “last days”, it was reported in the AWAKE (April 22, 1967) “is that girls under seventeen years of age account for about 50,000 annual out-of-wedlock births in America.”
    Under the heading, “Disease Rise”, the AWAKE stated: “‘At least one out of every 250 teenage boys and girls (in the United States) was infected with gonorrhea in fiscal year 1966’, stated a report prepared by several medical associations. The report added: ‘Since actual incidence of infection among all age groups is considered to be four times the reported incidence, the figures presented here considerably understate the seriousness of the problem.'”
    The AWAKE went on, “Last year reported cases of syphilis numbered 22,473 and of gonorrhea, 334,949. Teenage cases of syphilis rose 12.4 per cent in 1964 and 1965. The associations said that gonorrhea presented a particularly difficult public health problem because women could have the disease and not know it and because antibiotic-resistant strains of gonorrhea bacteria were growing in number,”
    “The Evangelist of Truth” in U.S.A. stated: “America is experiencing the worst wave of teenage sex delinquency ever known in the history of the world, and crime is now increasing four times as fast as the population. The entire cause can be laid at the door of the movies, television and rotten literature.”
    No one can claim complete ignorance of the dangers of that tragic illness known as venereal disease. It can lead to blindness, impotence, insanity and death. Yet men and women of uncontrollable sexual passions do contribute to spreading it. The New Zealand Herald (November 10, 1967) reported that “some Auckland girls have come to regard venereal disease as a kind of ‘status symbol’ which boosts them in the eyes of contemporaries who are similarly lacking in morals”.
    Sweden is another place that is notorious for immorality. Now the grave consequences of juvenile delinquency are weighing heavily on that country and the people are already feeling seriously concerned about the situation.
    Swedish teenagers are said to be indifferent to shame and all decent virtues. Boys and girls drink and make love all night. In daylight they pet in public and do not care what the world thinks of them. Whole towns are plagued with screaming nude girls and the blare of transistor radios.
    In the TIT-BITS, issue of the week ending May 23, 1964, a writer had this to say about the incidents of immorality in Sweden:
    “SOMETIMES more than 100 arrests are made in one evening but these are only made after police charges aimed at breaking up mobs of drunken, sex- mad teenagers.
    “The situation is now so serious that 140 Swedish physicians have petitioned King Gustav and the government, asking them to take steps to stop sexual laxity which is a ‘menace to the vitality and health of the nation’.
    “These doctors are not alarmists, In Sweden, pre-marital intercourse is condoned and abortions are legal. What is the result?” asked the writer. He then went on: “Statistics show that gonorrhea has increased nearly 100 per cent in the past five years – and more than 50 per cent of new cases are teenagers. This carefree attitude towards sex, apart from spreading disease, does not even make it enjoyable.” Said Dr. Sigurd Elvin, one of the doctors who signed the petition: “Young people in Sweden are not happy. They lack the Ten Commandments in their upbringings,” (Emphasis ours).
    If those children’s parents had not attached more importance to secular training than spiritual education, if they had brought up those children “in the nurture and admonition of the Lord” (Ephesians 6: 1-4) they would not have been miserable or unhappy as Dr. Sigurd Elvin lamented.
    Bitterness of Sin
    In Britain it is the same story of moral decline, London has been described as “the shocking city” because of whoredom that is rampant there. It was reported that “in 1962 there were 8,835 illegitimate births in London, England, which was one-seventh of all the births recorded in that city for the entire year!”
    There is a school in South London where girls of 11-plus who are pregnant are cared for until they give birth to their children. A visitor to the school once wrote a story published in the TIT- BITS of May 23, 1964, which he captioned: “Heartbreak of the 11-plus Mothers”, It is a story that tens of the bitterness of sin and the meanness of man despite his claim to civilisation. He stated that “girls in this plight have to be lucky to get to the school – it can cope with only 12 girls at a time”.
    The writer told of no less than 1,000-odd girls in a year who became expectant mothers before the official school-leaving age of 15! For them as far as the Ministry of Education is concerned, formal education is finished and there is no place for them to find an escape from the sham and live out their last few months of childhood as children.
    The visitor further wrote: “I learned that often the fathers of the babies these girls are expecting are married men. Some are willing to accept the responsibility and help all they can, but many just leave the frightened girl to cope with the problem herself. Only a few of the prospective fathers are the same age as the girls. And they seldom marry the girl.” Note what the visitor said: “…the fathers of the babies these girls are expecting are married men”. Are many monogamists not fathers of out-of-wedlock children here in Nigeria too? Do some of them not look down on honest polygamists? and do they – the monogamists – not parade themselves as the gentlemen and elites of society? Hypocrites!
    It is clear from the disclosures in this sermon that the standard of morals in some countries abroad is not commendable. It is foolishness and a show of immaturity for anybody therefore to feel that he is better than anyone else just because he has been to any oversea country.
    It is those things that arc good in Western civilisation that we should accept and make use of, but those that are bad must be condemned and thrown off. The tendency to ape everything that comes from Europe or America is one of the factors that are responsible for the moral weakness of our people.
    Loose Dance
    For example, the Western style of dancing in which a man holds a woman, perhaps another man’s wife, on her hip in very close proximity face to face, shoulder to shoulder or breast to breast – is immodest and ungodly. It is unchristian, and it provokes jealousy. “For jealousy is the rage of a man”, says the word of God, (Proverbs 6: 34) Even the African custom does not allow it. But today those who want to be “modern” so as to be classified among the “elites” or “intelligentsia” take pride in doing these things.
    The loose or nominal Christian may take offence and call the GKS names for condemning this type of European dance. For condemning anything we have strong reasons. That this type of European dance is immoral is evidenced by the confession of certain women in the United States.
    “The Chicago Vice Commission in the United States, tried to find why girls ‘went bad’. Over 300 women whose lives were ruined, many of whom were prostitutes, said, ‘My first step wrong was caused by the dance.” (African Challenge, July, 1957, page 5)
    However, we are gratified that from the lectures of the GKS many sober and responsible people have had cause to ponder these things and to refrain from them. They have also stopped their wives and daughters from engaging themselves in such a loose dance.
    Another thing that must be discouraged if moral corruption is to be wiped out of Nigeria and other parts of the world is the concept of “boy and girl friend”. Some men – “gentlemen” – of about 50 years of age feel very happy when they are referred to by young girls of 18 or 20, as their “boy friends”. And so too some old women feel honoured when they are called by young men as their “girl friends”. This is funny; but it is in fact foolishness. In the Lagos Weekend of Friday, July 12, 1968, a writer had this to say: “In Nigeria when a man and a woman refer to each other as ‘my girl friend’ and ‘my boy friend’, the implication is that both of them are entitled to have sexual intercourse together throughout the duration of their friendship.”
    What the devil always does in luring men to sin is first of all to make them develop a carefree attitude so that a sinful act is not considered as anything serious.
    Take a look at the beauty competitions of the world, You will find that the process through which a girt is declared “Miss Mini-skirt”, “Miss Telephone” or “Miss Ilegogoro” is dotted with many things that contravene Christian principles and tradition, For a girl to put on a scanty dress, which nearly exposes her whole body and appear before a group of men regarded as judges, is foolish and repugnant to the Christian mind. It is very sad to note that certain responsible men and women, whom the young generation should look to for guidance in the right path, are putting in every effort to encourage these things. If this is the way we would want Nigeria to match with the times, then there is cause for fear.
    Women generally were created by God in such a way that shamefacedness is a virtue to them. It was St. Paul who stated: “In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; but (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.” – 1 Timothy 2: 9.
    Once a man or woman loses his or her sense of shame, there is no evil thing – no matter how mean it may be – that he or she cannot do. The Bible says “the unjust knoweth no shame.”
    The Sunday Times of July 1, 1968, published an article of a certain girl who said she thanked heavens for being single, As all people cannot be foolish, some responsible married women cried ‘shame’ on her in their replies published in the Sunday Times of July 21, 1968.
    Young women who do not want to marry and who are leading immoral life are not only a “menace to the vitality and health of the nation”, but are also the instruments of destruction. So too foolish married women who are seducing men to committing adultery are a spiritual danger leading the unfaithful and infidels to “the depths of hell”. (Proverbs 9: 12-18) How many young men have had their lives ruined through these devilish women no one can really tell! It is only by the fear of God through the keeping of His commandments that men can escape from the snares of Satan these creatures constitute.
    King Solomon, writing on the conduct of immoral women, stated: “For the commandment (of God) is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life: to keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman. Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelid, For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life “ – Proverbs 6: 23-29.
    Warning
    Concerning the Jews of old St. Paul stated: “But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness…Neither be ye (Christians) idolaters, as were some of them…Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come.” – 1 Corinthians 10: 5-11.
    Men and women everywhere must take warning from what the natural Jew” suffered because of sin. Jesus Christ, knowing the danger of worldliness, gave this warning: “And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day (the day of God’s vengeance) come upon you unawares… Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of Man.” – Luke 21: 34-36.
    Anyone who has a prick of conscience is advised to repent sincerely and put a stop, by Christ’s power, to his immoral living, He can be Sure of God’s pardon, by His grace, notwithstanding how deep he has sunk into the pool of iniquity, “Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon.” – Isaiah 55: 7; see also Proverbs 28: 13, 14; 2 Peter 3: 9.
    You as a Christian are required to live up to the principles of Christianity, You must not set your heart on this godless world, or its attractions, or all the glamour of its life, Let not the ungodly or unprincipled men seduce you with their errors from the lofty way – the way of holiness; but rather keep your foothold on the solid rock of faith, and maintain your integrity to the glory of God for your own salvation. (Proverbs 1: 10; 1 Peter 4: 2-3, 7, 8,) St. Paul says: “Work out your own salvation with (godly) fear and trembling.”`,

    content:`ALTHOUGH there is the proposal for Church unity, it is common knowledge that the question as to who is the head of the Church is one of the issues on which there still exists an area of disagreement. The right answer to this question is of paramount importance because it touches on the very foundation of the divine institution that is known as Church.
    The issue of doctrines is very important in the Christian Faith. St. Paul warned Timothy, a bishop in the early Church, to guard the doctrines of God jealously and charged him to warn others to “TEACH NO OTHER DOCTRINE”. – 1 Timothy 1: 3; 4: 16; see also Galatians 1: 8, 9, A. V.
    It is an article of faith of the Roman Catholic Church that Peter the apostle was the ‘rock’ upon which Jesus Christ built his Church and that Peter was chosen to be the “Head of the Church” and the “Chief of the Apostles”. Linked with this is the claim that every Pope or Bishop of Rome is a successor of St. Peter.
    The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Baltimore, James Cardinal Gibbons, stated: “The Catholic Church teaches also that our Lord conferred on St. Peter the first place of honor and jurisdiction in the government of His whole Church, and that the same spiritual supremacy has always resided in the Popes, or Bishops of Rome, as being the successors of St. Peter.” (The Faith Of Our Fathers, Eighty-third Revised Edition, page 78.)
    A Catholic Dictionary, Second Edition, Revised, defines the “Church of Christ” as “the visible religious society… instituted directly by Christ. under one head, St. Peter and his successors, the popes.. .” (Page 97).
    A Roman Catholic magazine – the Catholic Voice, issue of June 1956 – had this to say: “…Our Divine Lord called Peter the ‘rock’ on which His Church would be built …” (page 81). And answering a question as to why our Lord appeared to St. Peter, the Catholic Voice of July 1956, stated: “…We presume that He did so because He had chosen Peter to be the Head of His Apostles and the Church.” (Page 102)
    The issues involved in this matter are very serious and are of tremendous spiritual interest to both Roman Catholics and Protestants alike as well as any other person who desires to acquire an accurate knowledge of the Christian Faith. It is the more interesting that the Roman Catholic Church bases its teaching about the primacy of Peter not merely on ‘tradition’ but on the Scripture.
    Holy Bible
    We must admit that the awakening of the interest of the Catholics in the Holy Bible is a significant development in Christendom. Under the heading, “BACK TO THE BIBLE”, a Catholic newspaper, the INDEPENDENT of October 16-22, 1966, published: “One effect of the Ecumenical Council has been to re-awaken our interest in the Bible…Not only must Priests find in the Bible the source of their sacred learning, nourishment for their interior life and substance for the instruction of their people, but the people, too, should be encouraged and helped to read the sacred scriptures for themselves.” In Course No. 6 of the “Catholic Enquiry Centre”, published at Owerri, Nigeria, it is positively stated: “And for a Catholic the whole Bible is the word of God…It is a Catholic teaching that there is no error in the Bible.”
    We of the God’s Kingdom Society always endeavour to keep an open mind towards one and all. It is our policy to call a spade a spade, or truth, truth, no matter who says it because we firmly believe that the truth belongs to God. Therefore, if the Roman Catholics are right we must sincerely admit that they are right, but if they are wrong, yes, we should not only say so but we should also prove from the Holy Bible, which they believe is “the word of God”, that they are wrong.
    Indeed, we quite agree with Rev. John Laux, M. A., author of A Course in Religion for Catholic High Schools and Academies (Part III) when he stated that we should enlarge our knowledge, cultivate our reason, “to get an insight in- to the relation of truth to truth; to learn to view things as they are”.
    Now let us turn to the Holy Bible to get an insight into the relation of scripture to scripture about the truth of the question, “Who is the Head of the Church?” In order to avoid misgivings and for the benefit of our Catholic friends, all Bible references in this sermon, except otherwise expressly stated, are from the Douay Version which some call ‘Roman Catholic Bible’.
    This Rock
    When Jesus Christ came to the coasts of Cesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples: “Who do men say that the Son of man is?” Some people, the disciples told him, said John the Baptist, some Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets. Jesus then asked: “But who do you say that I am?” Simon Peter replied, “Thou art Christ, the Son of the Living God.” (Matthew 16:13-16) Following this reply, Jesus said: “Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jona; because flesh and blood hath not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in heaven. And I say to thee that: Thou art Peter: and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.”- Matthew 16: 17, 18.
    What has been described as the “charter of the Papacy” is drawn from this declaration of Christ. Thus in answer to Question 88, The Explanatory Catechism states: “I know that Christ appointed St. Peter to be the Head of the Church, because Christ said to him: ‘Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build My Church…’ (Matt. xvi. 18, 19.)”
    At this juncture, we must say outright that the interpretation given the text by the Roman Catholic Church has given cause for dispute among Christians because some believe that Jesus Christ NEVER made Peter the head of the Church. No one, apart from Jesus Christ himself or God’s word in the Bible, is competent to settle this dispute. Jesus Christ, it is clear in the Bible, did not say St. Peter is the rock; neither did he say that the church was built upon him nor that he was the head of the Church. Rather Jesus Christ himself is the rock upon which the Church is built, and he is the head of the Church. The truth of this in the Bible is so clear that there is no room for doubt for anyone who keeps his mind free from prejudice.
    When Jesus said, “Thou art Peter”, we know as a rule in grammar that Peter was the second person. And when Christ added, “and upon THIS rock”, we can as well understand that he was no longer referring to the second person – Peter. If peter were the rock, Christ would have said, “Thou art Peter, and upon thee, the rock, I will build my church”. The contrast between “THOU” and “THIS” should not be confused. So when he said, “and upon THIS rock”, Christ was pointing to him- self, the Son of the Living God, as the one upon whom the Church would be built.
    In fact, he is the rock or foundation stone. This fact is strengthened by St. Paul’s statement concerning the natural Jews, to wit: “And all drank the same spiritual drink; (And they drank of the spiritual rock that followed them; and THE ROCK WAS CHRIST.)” – 1 Corinthians 10: 4.
    The Foundation
    The “Catholic Truth Society” of London stated in a pamphlet, What Do You Know about St. Peter and His Successors…: “One such essential feature of the Church was undoubtedly the authority of St. Peter. It was the foundation, and what could be more essential to any building than the foundation? If the foundation changes, the building changes. Our Lord actually compared His Church to a building erected on the foundation of St. Peter’s authority.”
    We agree that Jesus Christ likened the Church to a building but there is no passage in the whole Bible which states that St. Peter is the foundation of the Church.
    Long before the human existence of Jesus Christ it had been foretold that he would be a stone to be laid by God in Zion for a foundation-a stone, though rejected by human builders, that would still become the head-stone. (Psalm 117: 22,23; Isaiah 28: 16) Referring to Jesus Christ, St. Peter said to the Jews: “This is the stone which was rejected by you, the builders, which is become the head of the corner…” – Acts 4: 10- 12; 1 Peter 2: 6.
    The name Peter, from the Greek word Petros means a stone. It was Christ himself who called Simon, his apostle, Peter (John 1: 42) which spiritually signifies strong faith in God. Other faithful servants of Christ are also stones. That was why St. Peter wrote to the Christians: “Be you also as living stones built up, a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.” And turning to the prophecy relating to Christ, he added : “Wherefore it is said in the Scripture: Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner-stone, elect, precious… “- I Peter 2: 3-8.
    All the apostles make up the “Little Flock” but there are the “other sheep” whom Christ promised to gather. (Luke 12: 32; John 10: 16) Both the apostles, including Peter, who are the foundation members in the sense of being the predestinated and first fruits of Christ’s disciples, and the “other sheep” are all built on ONE foundation, which is Christ. Said St. Paul: “Now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners; but you are fellow citizens with the saints and the domestics of God, built upon the foundation of the APOSTLES and PROPHETS (note – NOT Peter alone, but all the apostles). Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner-stone, in who m (Christ, not Peter) all the building, being framed together, groweth up into an holy temple in the Lord. In whom (Christ) you also are built together into an habitation of God in the Spirit.” – Ephesians 2: 19-22.
    Whatever remains in the argument of the Catholics, if any at all, is knocked out by St. Paul when he stated: “For other foundation no man can lay, but that which is laid: WHICH IS CHRIST JESUS.”- I Corinthians 3:11.
    Saint Peter was at no time given supreme power over the other apostles. If by Christ’s saying “Thou art Peter” and so forth, he was understood by the apostles to have made Peter their head, why was it that after that occasion they still “disputed among themselves, which of them should be the greatest”? Even then Jesus did not say Peter was greater than anyone of them but he said, “For he that is the lesser among you all he is the greater.” – Mark 9: 33, 34; Luke 9: 46-48.
    St. Paul whose wisdom was commended by St. Peter, laboured more than all the apostles (1 Corinthians 15: 10) and he did not consider himself inferior to Peter or any other apostle. He said: “For in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.” – 2 Corinthians 12: 11; 11: 5, King James or Authorised Version (A. V.).
    St. Peter recognised that he was an elder or an overseer just as other apostles were. He wrote: “The elders which are among you I exhort, who AM ALSO AN ELDER, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed: feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof…” (1 Peter 5: 1-3, A.V.) He did not say he was the only elder or head of the apostles.
    That Christ Jesus is the head of the Church and not St. Peter, there is no doubt. Concerning Christ it is written: “…And He (God Almighty) hath subjected all things under his (Christ’s) feet and hath made him (Christ) head over all the Church…” – Ephesians I: 19-23.
    Exhorting the Christians in regard to the duties of husband and wife, Saint Paul used the relationship between Christ and the Church as an example, and showed that Jesus Christ, not Peter. is the head of the Church. Said he: “Let women be subject to their husbands, as to the Lord; because the husband is the head of the wife, AS CHRIST IS THE HEAD OF THE CHURCH. He is the saviour of his body. Therefore, as the church is subject to Christ (not Peter, we reiterate) so also let the wives be to their husbands in all things.” – Ephesians 5: 22-24.
    What is more, Saint Paul described Jesus Christ as “the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature”. He added: “And he (Christ) is the HEAD OF THE BODY, THE CHURCH; who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things he (Christ) may hold the primacy; because in him, it hath well pleased the Father that all fullness should dwell…” – Colossians 1: 15-20.
    The truth of the matter is already made bare. Some may ignore it or argue it – it remains the truth, God’s word of truth says that God “hath made him (Christ, NOT Peter) Head over all the Church”. All we can do, if we are true to our conscience, is to accept the truth for our own good in the Lord. “For we can do nothing against the truth; but for the truth.” (2 Corinthians 13: 8) And Jesus said, “You shall know the truth; and the truth shall make you free.”`,

    content:`THE confidence that prayers, which are in accord with the will of God, are answered is an essential ingredient of faith in the Christian Religion. It is a person who lacks such confidence that sees nothing good in praying to the Almighty God.
    Prayer is a solemn petition or request or giving of thanks to God. It is an act of worship that pre-supposes the insufficiency of the person saying it, and his dependence on God.
    Instances of prayers that were answered by God abound in the Holy Bible. When the Israelites were suffering under the bondage of the Egyptians during their sojourn in Egypt, they cried to God. “And God heard their groaning, and God remembered His covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob…” (Exodus 2: 23-25) As a result of this, God, through His angel, chose Moses and sent him to Egypt to deliver the children of Israel from servitude. To Moses He said: “Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them. Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.” (Exodus 3: 9, 10). The success that crowned the mission of Moses is a well known fact of Bible history.
    Hannah was one of the two wives of Elkanah, the son of Jeroham. The other woman, Peninnah, had children but, Hannah whom their husband loved more was barren. She was made an object of reproach by her enemies because she had no child. However, she believed that God Almighty could give her the desire of her heart. She went into the temple and, in the bitterness of her soul, earnestly prayed to the Lord. In her prayer she vowed and said: O Lord of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine hand- maid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his life…” – 1 Samuel 1:9-11.
    As Hannah prayed silently, Eli the priest, who sat beside the door-post of the temple, observed that her lips moved but her voice was not heard. He thought that she was drunk and went on to scold her. “How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee”, chided the priest. But Hannah promptly answered: “No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the Lord. Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.”- 1 Samuel 1: 12-16.
    As soon as Eli heard her reply, he blessed her to go in peace, and added: “And the God of Israel grant thee thy petition…”
    God’s due time came that Hannah’s prayer was answered. She conceived and gave birth to a male child whom she called Samuel meaning asked of God. (1 Samuel 1: 17- 20) When she brought the child to the temple for presentation according to Jewish custom, she reminded the priest, Eli, that she was the woman who stood by him in the temple praying to the Lord. She then said: “For this child I prayed; and the Lord hath given me my petition which I asked of him: therefore also I have lent him to the Lord; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the Lord.” (1 Samuel 1: 24-28) This is another good example to show that God answers prayers.
    Divine Force
    Let us go a step further under the reign of King Hezekiah the cities of Judah were invaded by Assyria – a very hostile enemy to them in those days. The King of Assyria, Sennacherib, boasted of his might and blasphemed the God of Israel. He issued threats and warned Hezekiah and his people not to put their trust in the Lord their God nor think that they could be delivered from his hand. He then sent a letter, in which he reproached the Most High, to Hezekiah.
    On receipt of the letter, Hezekiah went into the house of God and prayed. Among other things he said: “Incline thine ear, O Lord, and hear; open thine eyes, O Lord, and see: and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent to reproach the living God…Now therefore, O Lord our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the Lord, even thou only.” – Isaiah 37: 14-20.
    In answer to the prayer of Hezekiah, God defended Jerusalem, and His angel went out and killed 185,000 men in the Assyrian camp. Thus the king of Assyria, despite his boasts, threats and I blasphemies, found his army woefully defeated and was compelled by divine force to retreat to Nineveh where he lived. There, again, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch, his god, his own sons fell upon him and killed him with their swords. That was the ignominious end of that godless man. Read Isaiah chapters 36 and 37 for the details of this interesting account.
    Indeed, Jehovah, the Almighty God, is reputed for His wonderful acts which He did among His people in the days of old in answer to their prayers. David the king and prophet, who also derived great benefits from prayers, exclaimed in his song: “Praise waiteth for Thee, O God, in Sion…O Thou that hearest prayer, unto Thee shall all flesh come.”– Psalm 65:1,2.
    Prayer is a very good thing. It is forceful; it gives comfort and hope, and strengthens our will and faith. Through prayers, the ancient worthies – holy men and women of old – did and achieved great things. “The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much”, said James the apostle. He then went on to show how the prophet Elijah “prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months. And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit”. – James 5: 16-18.
    Whatever is our need, let us take it to the Lord in prayer; and provided it is not tainted with sin, He will grant us the desire of our hearts. We as Christians are admonished never to be anxious for anything, “but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God”. – Philippians 4: 6.
    God’s Time
    When some people pray and they do not get what they ask for within a month, six months, a year or two, they grow impatient and become lukewarm in their religious devotions. They, having developed a feeling of hopelessness, and lost faith in the Almighty God, turn to seek aid from idols, witch-doctors and so forth. This is very bad of those professing to be Christians. We must know that whatever we pray for will be granted us not according to our will but God’s will, and in His own due time. We are therefore required to wait on the Lord (Psalm 27: 13, 14), and it is commonly said that “God’s time is the best”.
    For the faithful worshipper, God’s denial of his request is no cause for despair or unhappiness because he trusts that whatever the all-wise God does is the best. It was this understanding that made Jesus Christ say in his prayer to the Heavenly Father, “not my will, but thine, be done”. What we may consider to be good for us may turn out to work against our well-being. We should therefore leave things to God and accept His decision always.
    Furthermore, we should learn to be patient. Take for example the case of Zacharias and his wife, Elisabeth. It is on record that “they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless”, but they had no child, even though they prayed for it, until they were well stricken in years. (Luke 1: 5-7) When it was God’s time, as Zacharias officiated as a priest in the temple, an angel of the Lord appeared to him and said: “Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John ” – Luke 1: 8-14.
    True to the word of the angel, Elisabeth became pregnant and in her old age she brought forth a man child who grew and became the famous fore-runner of Christ our Saviour. We can see how it is rewarding to be patient in waiting on the Lord while continuing to practise righteousness.
    Obstacle
    Sin is an obstacle to prayers. Many prayers are not answered due to sin, or because the people “ask amiss” (i.e. in the wrong way) for their selfish ends. As it is written: “Behold, the Lord’s hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear: but your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.” –  Isaiah 59: 1, 2; see also James 4: 3.
    It is true, God does not hear sinners but if any sinner repents and worships Him in truth, his prayers will be answered. “Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth His will, him He heareth.” (John 9: 31) And John the apostle stated: “And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.” – 1 John 3: 22.
    If a wicked man prays, as some often do, and his desire is accomplished, we should know that it is not God that answers his prayer but the mimic god, Satan the devil, who is the author of evil. A thief can pray so that he may succeed to break into people’s houses and make away with their goods, and he may really be successful in his operation. It ” is not God that helps him but the arch-enemy of God and man, Satan. How can God help, him when he is acting contrary to God’s law which says, “Thou shalt not steal”? All things or wealth acquired by evil means are under curse. God will surely punish the evildoer. (Job 20: 4-8; Proverbs 11:21; 13: 11; Isaiah 3:11) The Bible says that God does not help an evildoer. (Job 8: 20) And it is also written: “He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law (of God), even his prayer shall be abomination.” – Proverbs 28: 9; see also Psalm 66: 18; Proverbs 15: 29.
    Prayer of Faith
    Unless we pray in line with the will of God, we should not expect our prayers to be answered. Saint John stated: “And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, be heareth us: and if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions ‘that we desired of him.” – 1 John 5: 14, 15.
    All prayers must be directed to God ONLY through His Son, Jesus Christ, whom He made the mediator between Himself and men. This is important. Prayers through any other medium are’ not answered by God. – John 14: 13, 14; 15: 16; Ephesians 5: 20; 1 Timothy 2: 5, 6.
    It is also a matter of must that FAITH must underlie our prayers if they are meant to serve any useful purpose. Jesus said: “And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, BELIEVING, ye shall receive.” (Matthew 21: 22) Saint James enjoined that whoever lacks wisdom should ask of God who gives to all men liberally and he added: “But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. For let not that (FAITHLESS) man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.” (James 1: 5-7) It was the same apostle who said: “Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. …Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him and the PRAYER OF FAITH shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.” – James 5: 13-15.
    Jesus Christ warned that we should not behave like hypocrites who “love to pray standing in: the synagogues and in the Corner of the streets, that they may be seen of men”. Rather we should say our prayers in private’, “and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly”. The habit of shouting, “Jesu, Jesu” (as if Jesus is deaf) – and repeating words over and over again, .as some do, is unchristian. Jesus Christ said that’ when ye pray, use not vain repetitions” – Matthew 6: 5-8.
    Now that it has been established beyond all doubt that God answers prayers, we must form the habit of praying always, particularly in this sin-ridden and dangerous age in which we are living. (Luke 21:25-28, 33-36; 1 Timothy 2:1-4) Jesus Christ in a parable taught “that men ought always to pray, and not to faint”.  (Luke 18:1-8) And St. Paul exhorted: “Pray without ceasing.” (1 Thessalonians 5:17) This does not mean that we should lose all sense of moderation, and pray frantically and fanatically.  There is time for everything. (Ecclesiastes 3:1-8) Except one is suddenly face with danger, which could make one pray or call on God excitedly for help, one should always be cool and sober when praying.
    In conclusion, let us remember at all times the admonition of Saint Peter: “But the end of all things is at hand: BE YE THEREFORE SOBER, AND WATCH UNTO PRAYER” – 1 Peter 4:5`, 
    title:"DOES GOD ANSWER PRAYER?"},
 {key:11, 
    content:`A WOMAN, by reason of her faith, knowledge and good understanding, can rise to a place of honour in the Church but there are offices and privileges which God never assigns to women.

    In certain church denominations women are allowed to stand in the pulpit before a mixed congregation to preach sermons or read out lessons, or say prayers on behalf of all others. When Dr. Billy Graham visited Nigeria some years ago, a certain woman mounted the pulpit at his campaign meeting at the Race Course, now Tafawa Balewa Square, Lagos, on Saturday January 30, 1960, and led, in an ill vocation or prayer, a vast congregation made up of bishops, apostles, evangelists, priests and so forth. However, in an open letter to the doctor evangelist published in the local newspapers then, the GKS showed from the Scriptures the impropriety of that practice.
    
    There are those who send out their women to preach in the streets and from house to house. Some of these women do claim to have received the anointing of the Holy Spirit or to have been ordained by God to preach the gospel. Among those who regard themselves as prophetesses are some whose mission is to go along the streets ringing bells in the early morning to wake people from bed and shouting, “Wake and pray.’ in their tribal tongues. Thus we find that in certain church groups every other member is either a prophet or prophetess-and all claim to see visions and prophesy. So, people have been asking to know the true position of women in the Church.
    
    We have often said that a number of wrong things are being done by many who claim to be Christians. This is so because the rules and doctrines of Jesus Christ as set out in the Scriptures are often relegated to the background and substituted with men’s invented dogmas.
    
    There is not a single instance in the Bible of a woman who was ordained by God as a prophetess to teach or lead His people.
    
    Presumptuousness
    
    Some women were improperly called prophetesses in the Bible simply because they played some roles in the affairs of God’s people. Nobody can prove that God ordained any of them. Miriam, the sister of Moses and Aaron, was called a prophetess as recorded in Exodus 15: 20, just because she led the women of Israel (not men) in a victory dance after the Egyptians were drowned in the Red Sea. To show that she was not ordained to be a prophetess, God punished her with leprosy when she joined Aaron to assume that God was also using them, and they murmured against Moses. They said: “Hath the Lord indeed spoken only by Moses? Hath he not spoken also by us? “Because of this God was angry, and He said: “If there be a prophet among you, I the Lord will make myself known unto him in a vision, and will speak unto him in a dream… Wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses? And behold, Miriam became leprous, white as snow…” (Numbers 12: 1-15). It is worthy of note that Aaron was not punished – indeed he was ordained a priest – but Miriam suffered for her presumptuous.
    
    As regards men like Moses, Joshua, Daniel, David, Elijah, Isaiah, Jeremiah and a host of others, it is clearly shown in the Bible that they were ordained by God. But who can cite any instance to show that God appointed any woman at any time to lead or teach His people?
    
    It is a shame for men to be led by women in God’s Organisation, and above all, it is contrary to the will of God. Men ought to rule or lead women. It was when the Jews because of their sins were forsaken by God that women dominated them. And God said: “As for my people, children are their oppressors and women role over them. O my people, they which lead thee cause thee to err, and destroy the way of thy paths.” – Isaiah 3:12.
    
    The Roman Catholic Church is aware of the position of women, and they do not allow them to fulfil the functions of priests. Answering a question as to why Rev. Sisters are not allowed to say mass, the Catholic Voice of July 1956, stated among other things: “Since our Divine Lord chose only men as His Apostles so only men can become priests.” And a Catholic newspaper, the INDEPENDENT or March 10-16, 1968, stated: “Men only can receive the Sacrament of Holy Orders: this is the law of God. Christ called men only to the apostolate, and ordained men only to the priesthood…” Obviously, this is the truth and the Roman Catholic Church gets our support.
    
    When the Church of Sweden proposed to ordain women priests, the then Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Fisher, warned the Archbishop of Sweden that “if Sweden ordains women priests, relations between the two churches will be broken off.” (Vide the British Daily Sketch, January 15, 1959)
    
    Foible of Watchtower
    
    In the Salvation Army, they have women ministers who perform the same duties as men. For this, they were severely criticised by the Watchtower Society. In the Watchtower magazine issue of September 1, 1962, page 540, the Watchtower Society wrote: “An unusual feature of the organisation is the prominence accorded women…As a result; women have had much to do with the direction and policy of the Salvation Army, often taking the oversight of men. In fact, for thirty years Evangeline Booth served as the head of the Salvation Army in the United States, and for five years directed the entire world-wide organisation…In granting women equal ministerial privileges the Salvation Army does not follow Bible precedent…” (Emphasis ours)
    
     It can be recalled that the question of women claiming to be anointed or ordained by God to preach from house to house is one of the doctrinal issues on which the first President of the God’s Kingdom Society, Brother G. M. Urhobo, disagreed with the Watchtower Society and for which he was persecuted and is still being slandered by those people who call themselves Jehovah’s Witnesses. Many of their women claim to be anointed, and the latitude given the women had caused trouble in that organisation. In the book, LIGHT Book One, the Watchtower Society stated: “One of the original incorporators of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society was a woman, the wife of the president thereof, and she insisted on editing The Watch Tower and, being resisted, led other women to take a wrongful course against the Lord’s work … Even to this day the same influence attempts to interfere with the Lord’s work … The Lord had pointed out that the woman has her place in the church, but her place is not to teach man nor attempt to influence man in his rightful performance of duty as a servant of the Lord.” (Pages 30-31, emphasis ours) But we ask: If women are ordained by God to preach why should the wife of the President who claimed to be ordained be “resisted” for insisting on editing the Society’s magazine when she was not proved to be inefficient? If the women receive the same anointing which the men have and which put both sexes on equal spiritual status as the Watchtower Society is teaching there should be no reason why the women should be prevented from discharging the duties for which they are ordained. Here lies the foible of the Watchtower Organisation!
    
    The Law
    
    The truth, as the GKS has always maintained, is that God has never ordained or anointed any woman to be a preacher or teacher. If it were God’s will that women should hold such a post in His organisation, Jesus Christ would have: shown an example by choosing one woman, at least, to be an apostle. But he did not, and even when he selected other 70 disciples whom he sent out, two by two, no woman was included. (Matthew 10: 1-7; Mark 3: 13-19; Luke 10: 1-17) Though Jesus Christ had many women disciples, he did not send any of them to go about preaching.
    
    It is contrary to the Christian rule for a woman to teach and lead men. St. Paul stated: “Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence. For Adam was first formed, then Eve. And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression. Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.” (1 Timothy 2: 11-15) St. Paul did not say that women would be saved if they preached from house to house or in the street.
    
    Women are described by St. Peter as “weaker vessels” and in modern terms they are known as the “softer sex”. To send them to go from house to house preaching is tantamount to exposing them to temptations. Modesty will restrain us from going into the details of certain reports about some women that have come to light in connection with their house-to-house preaching activities.
    
    For allowing Jezebel who posed to be a prophetess to teach and to seduce men to commit fornication, the Church of Thyatira was rebuked. The Lord said: “Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication…” – Revelation 2: 20-23.
    
    The Watchtower Society’s members cannot claim to be ignorant of these Bible facts. In their book, “Equipped for Every Good Work” (page 322), they commented on St. Paul’s epistle to Timothy thus: “… The woman is not to usurp authority over the man, but is to learn in silence and not be suffered to teach in the congregation or assembly. This is the Theocratic order.” (Emphasis ours) From this it would appear that they understand that women are not ordained to be teachers or preachers. But the practice among them up till today is quite the opposite of the “Theocratic order”!
    
    Women must not make speeches in the congregation or assembly of the Lord’s people. Even if they have doubt on any issue, the law estops them from asking questions in the church. As it is written: “Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law. And if they will learn anything, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.” (1 Corinthians 14: 34, 35) It was on the basis of this authority we criticised Dr. Billy Graham when he allowed a woman to lead a congregation of bishops, deacons, and so on, in prayer at his campaign meeting.
    
    In violation of the law of God quoted above, the Watchtower Society allowed Miss V. Dougaluk, Miss M. Hinds and Miss R. M. Dreyer to address an international assembly of” Jehovah’s Witnesses” at the Yankee Stadium, New York City, U.SA., on July 23, 1953, This was published in the Report of New World Society Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Yankee Stadium – New York City, July 19-26, 1953 at page 29. In the same report it was published on page 77, that “U.V. Glass gave sound advice to the sisters” – female members. He said among other things that a woman should not be upset “when a brother tries to counsel her”, He added: “She should comment at meetings, but should not try to be a ‘one-woman meeting.’ She will do better by giving others a chance to comment,” Does this advice not run counter to the law of God as stated by St. Paul? The law says, “IT IS NOT PERMITTED UNTO THEM (women) TO SPEAK”! Why should she “comment at meetings”?
    
    GKS Vindicated
    
    In a recent publication, Life Everlasting in the Freedom of the Sons of God, the Watchtower Society treated at length “The Places of Man and Woman in God’s Arrangement”, and therein they have come to agree with the GKS at last that women had never been ordained by God as priests, prophets, apostles or bishops. The following extracts from the book are quite explicit:
    
    “The one whom Jehovah God raised up to liberate the twelve tribes of Israel from Egyptian slavery was a man, Moses the son of Amram. The ones whom God chose to do priestly service to him in behalf of the nation of Israel were men, the man Aaron and his sons…God made no arrangement for priestesses…” (Page 248).
    
     “Then the time came for Jesus to pick out twelve workers to be with him all the rest of his earthly ministry, whom did he pick? Men, twelve of them, and he sent them forth as apostles, Likewise, when he sent out seventy additional evangelizers, it was men that he selected for this privilege of service. (Luke 10: 1-17) In such choosing Jesus was following God’s pattern. Some women in proper circumstances enjoyed some privileges in connection with Jesus, but not those of the twelve apostles and the seventy evangelizers.” (Page 250, emphasis ours)
    
     “It becomes plain that the Most High God Jehovah followed the same dealing with regard to the Christian ‘Congregation of God,’ or spiritual Israel, as he did with regard to the Jewish congregation of pre-Christian times, or natural, circumcised Israel. That is to say, God gave the preference to the males, the men, as regards official responsibilities within the theocratic organisation. This fact is emphasised for us in Ephesians 4:7-13… In that quotation from Paul’s letters the words ‘apostles,’ ‘prophets,’ evangelizers,’ shepherds and teachers are ALL in the masculine gender… In full accord with this, when the apostle Paul writes to Timothy about the qualifications for the service positions of ‘overseers’ and of ‘ministerial servants’ in the congregation, he specifically states that they must be men… (1 Timothy 3: I-10, 12)” (Pages 255- 256, emphasis ours).
    
    Surely, the foregoing excerpts are a vindication of Brother Gideon Urhobo and the God’s Kingdom Society. And we thank God.
    
    Good Works
    
    Although women have important duties to do in God’s organisation, they must not be vested with authority to lead or teach men, neither must they be allowed to address the church.
    
    The example of Jezebel is enough to warn any group of Christians to refrain from permitting their women to peddle with the word of God. There are other good works women should do in support of God’s work so as to be saved.
    
    In the days of Jesus Christ on earth, he praised very highly a certain woman for her good work when she poured very precious ointment on his head. The woman did not preach, yet Jesus said concerning her: “Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.” – Matthew 26: 6-13.
    
    We are not saying that a woman cannot talk God’s word at all – either by teaching her child the fear of God or preaching to another woman. She can, and that does not make her to be ordained by God. St. Paul stated that the aged women should “teach the younger women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children, to be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.” – Titus 2: 3-5.
    
    Note that St. Paul says that the women should be “keepers at home” and not house to house trotters. Rather, it is women who have cast off their faith that wander about. Concerning such women, St. Paul wrote: “And withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.” (1 Timothy 5: 13) The apostle then advised: “I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.” (Verse 14).
    
    Some people think that it is by preaching only that one can be saved. This is very wrong and misleading. To put woo men forward, posing as having been ordained by God, to preach IS A SIN. We should learn from the fate of Miriam and Jezebel. As the Watchtower Society rightly put it in their criticism of the Salvation Army, “in granting women equal ministerial privileges the Salvation Army does not follow Bible precedent”. And we add that any Church group which allows their women to preach in the streets and from house to house DOES NOT follow Bible precedent.
    
    If we as Christians know that we are not to do our will but the Lord’s, and if discipline and decency are to be maintained in the Church of God, it is very important that Christian principles and tradition as explained in this sermon must be adhered to. What is more, St. Paul says: “Let all things be done decently and in order.” God is against lawlessness, presumptuousness and confusion. – 1 Corinthians 14: 33.40.`, 
    title:"ARE WOMEN ORDAINED BY GOD TO PREACH THE GOSPEL?"},
 {key:12, 
    content:`THE tongue of man is a very small member of the human body but what is in its power is great. It can be a source of blessing, spiritually or materially, and contrariwise, the same tongue is able to set the whole body on fire or trouble that is beyond human control.
    We know very well that the tongue is a fleshy movable organ in the mouth, used in, talking, tasting, licking and so on. In this sermon we are concentrating on the aspect of its use in regard to talking because herein lies its power – good or bad.
    The way many people talk glibly now-a-days without caring a damn gives the impression that some – and they are great in number – do not know how to use the tongue aright.
    There is no one who loves righteousness or who has developed a taste for decency that cannot be overwhelmed with a feeling of revulsion when he finds himself in the company of some people. All sorts of loose talks and perverse words come out of their mouths. At motor parks, in hotels, pubs, and even in some offices or when travelling in lorries, buses and so forth, men and women engage freely in irresponsible and indecorous talks. No word is considered too indecent or filthy for them to utter.
    All these bespeak how far away from righteousness or how corrupt men’s minds are. They make us cast our minds in retrospect to the events that led to the utter destruction of the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah by God in the days of old. But Lot, the nephew of Abraham, who kept himself away from the immorality of the Sodomites was saved. The Bible states that when he was in the midst of the ungodly, he was always vexed with the filthy conversations of the people. And St. Peter, in a really passionate vein, wrote in his epistle about this aspect of the experience of Lot thus: “For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds.” – 2 Peter 2: 7. 8.
    Corrupt Communication
    You may come across a man – call him a gentleman – who is well dressed and who appears sophisticated, walking in a way that commands dignity. But let him utter a word and you will be amazed to find that he is not better than a brute. Invite him into a conversation for a moment, you will be more astonished to notice that though the “gentleman” has gained mastery of all the grammar one can find in the text books, he has not the sense to distinguish between “holy conversation” and “profane language”.
    By the utterances of a person one can judge the sort of character he is. “For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.” Some people who like to talk much pour out most of the time words of no wisdom or profit, and thus they make themselves a laughing- stock before others. It is good to learn how to talk, when to talk, where and what to talk. There is a worldly saying that “he knows most who speaks least”. And the Scriptures put it in a clearer light: “He that hath knowledge spareth his words: and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit. Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise; and he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of under- standing.”– Proverbs 17: 27,28.
    Christians are warned against inconvenient jesting, foolish talks and unwholesome words. In Ephesians 4: 29, St. Paul admonished: “Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.” Furthermore, he said: “But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints; neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks. For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the; kingdom of Christ and of God.” – Ephesians 5: 3-7.
    Do some who call themselves Christians not indulge in these things? Let them judge themselves and repent so that they may be at peace with God.
    False Witness
    There are some people who use their tongues in telling lies, either in preaching the word of God or in bearing false witness against their neighbours, thus putting innocent peop1e in trouble. Some liars have the devilish boldness to appear even in the law courts to swear on the Holy Bible in the name of God. But the first sentences from their mouths in evidence are but a bundle of lies! They do not fear God, yet they swear in His name. , Except such ones repent and put a stop to their ungodly acts, God’s fiery judgment is certainly awaiting them for taking His name in vain. – Exodus 20: 7; Leviticus 19: 12; James 5: 12.
    In the days of Jeremiah the prophet there existed such treacherous fellows and he bewailed their sins because he knew that the Lord of hosts would certainly punish them. Concerning the liars, the prophet wrote: “And they bend their tongues like their bow for lies: but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth; for they proceed from evil to evil, and they know not me, saith the Lord…And they will deceive everyone his neighbour, and will not speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies, and weary themselves to commit iniquity…” – Jeremiah 9: 3-9.
    Dangerous Rumours
    By a mischievous use of the tongue some have inflamed the passions of others and led them into war resulting in the loss of thousands of souls. The misuse of the tongues of men has caused separation between brothers, sisters and friends, and has also led to the breaking of matrimonial homes.
    There are good reasons why governments do not tolerate spreading of false rurnours. In a broadcast to the nation on national security in July, 1967, the Nigerian Inspector-General of Police, Alhaji Kam Selem, said: “Do not assist in spreading false and dangerous rumours. Report all peddlers of such rumours and all acts of intimidation and threat to the Police at once.” This is so because false rumours, being an abuse of the tongue, are dangerous and can lead to death.
    People who cannot bridle their tongues but will go about opening their mouths wide in lying and in loose talks must get into trouble. David the prophet, knowing the danger of a bad use of the tongue and how unruly it is, said that he would be careful in what he did so that he might not sin with his tongue, and that he would keep his mouth with a bridle. (Psalm 39:1) “Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue,” said King Solomon, “keepeth his soul from troubles.” – Proverbs 21: 23.
    To use the tongue to backbite or slander or in any other evil way against people is wickedness. It is never well with those who engage in such bad things. David, in his prayer to the Almighty God, said: “Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the insurrection of the workers: of iniquity: who whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their bows to shoot their arrows, even bitter words: that they may shoot in secret at the perfect… They .encourage themselves in an evil matter: they commune of laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them?…But ‘God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly shall they the wounded…” – Psalm 64: 2-9.
    These things are happening in our time. It is the understanding of this wonderful knowledge of the Bible that sometimes make us of the GKS pay deaf ears to the reproaches, abuses or revilings and misrepresentations of our detractors. Despite their machinations and slander, the Lord’s work continues to flourish, by His grace, while, spiritually, they are dwindling. We do not wish them evil; rather we pray that they should repent so that God may forgive them. But if they will not repent, God’s punishment for slanderers awaits them. – Psalm 50: 19-23.
    Grave Consequences
    We must seize this opportunity to warn people against using their tongues in uttering blasphemies. For irreverent talks about God and sacred things will but incur grave consequences which they cannot stand or bear. The tongue must not be used in any evil way. “Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.” (Proverbs 18: 21).
    And Jesus Christ declared: “…Every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment. For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.” – Matthew 12: 36, 37.
    James the apostle of Christ gave an intelligible description of the tongue, showing how hard it is to control and the fruits of it. He stated: “For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body…Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth. Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasted great things. Behold, how great matter a little fire kindleth! And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.” – James 3: 2-6.
    The apostle went on: “For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind: but the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison. Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God. Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be…Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.” – James 3: 7-13.
    The Lip of Truth
    Although the tongue is difficult to control, Christians must endeavour to use theirs properly. St. James himself also said: “If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man’s religion is vain.” – James 1: 26.
    If we can learn to use our tongue aright the Lord will bless us and we will also command the respect of responsible people in society. We should use our tongues in confessing or in preaching the truth of God’s word in order to impart His saving knowledge to others; to sing praises to God and glorify His holy name. (Psalm 35: 28; 71: 15-19,23, 24) We can use our tongues to condemn evil, to expose lies, and to comfort the afflicted and exhort the feeble minded ones. Solomon also said: “There is that speaketh like the piercing of a sword: but the tongue of the wise is health. The lip of truth shall be established forever: but a lying tongue is but for a moment.” – Proverbs 12: 18, 19; see also Proverbs 15:4; 17:20.
    Finally, let us always beat in mind St. Peter’s admonition, to wit: “For be that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile: let him eschew evil, and do good: let him seek peace, and ensue it.” – 1 Peter 3: 10, 11.`,

    content:`OWING to the frail nature of men, which always makes them seek supernatural aid, they are easily influenced by beliefs most of which are misguided. One of such beliefs, which the devil has been using to hoodwink or mislead men, is born out of the idea that death is merely a change from a lower to a higher plane of existence.
    The belief that “the human personality continues to exist after death, and that it is possible for living persons to communicate with those who have died”, is ancient and very wide spread.
    In various parts of the world there are people who claim to have special powers by which they hold intercourse with the dead; they are known as spiritualists. And today, believers in spiritism hold to it as a sort of religion, a science and a philosophy.
    It is believed that a spiritualist can be a medium (which means a “go-between”) through whom “the souls or spirits of dead persons” can send messages to living persons. Under the heading of SPIRITUALISM, the Illustrated World Encyclopaedia (volume 18) has this, among other things, to say: “Usually spiritualists assemble in a meeting called a seance. The medium goes into a trance or deep sleep. During this trance, the spirit of the dead person supposedly enters the medium’s body and talks to living persons, or gives signs by knocking on tables or in some other way.”
    Superstition
    Many of the fears to which men have been subjected are either the figments of imagination or the devices of the devil aimed at alienating mankind from the purpose of God. One can but agree to a large extent with David Hume, a British philosopher, in his conclusion that “weakness, fear, melancholy, together with ignorance, are the true sources of Superstition”.
    Among many African tribes as well as some other nations, it is generally believed that as soon as a person dies he assumes supernatural powers which he can exercise – for good or evil – over the living. Hence there is the threatening statement by some people: “If you don’t help me, I’ll haunt you after my death.” There are people who worship their dead parents and pray to the dead to bless them with the good things of life even though they know that their parents in their life time; lived in abject poverty.
    Some who claim to be Christians share some of these wrong beliefs and practices. When certain Galatians Christians turned to heathenish rites in the days of St. Paul, he warned: “Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods. But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage?” – Galatians 4:8, 9.
    Dead Fathers
    When some people find themselves in certain unfavourable circumstances, they develop a bad state of mind, and fear even their own shadows. For this reason they are prone to believe everything which seems to give them temporary relief or false hope and they seek aid from witch doctors, magicians, dead fathers or relations and so forth.
    There is a story of someone who was said to have struck a bargain with a spiritualist so that he could talk with his dead father. The spiritualist assured him that it was quite possible and that the venue would be at a burial ground. The man, as the story went, paid a handsome sum of money to the spiritualist. On the appointed day, both of them went to the burial ground where another fake posing to be the “dead father” had earlier gone into hiding. And it was about midnight. As soon as they arrived at the cemetery, and of course, the spiritualist having recited some incantations, the fake dressed in white flowing robes emerged with a cane. The man was so frightened that he was trembling as the whole thing looked like a nightmare to him. Worse still, his so called father came close to him and started to administer severe strokes of the cane on him. He screamed and ran away under agonising pain without getting his “father’s” advice. The spiritualist blamed the failure of the mission on him for being unable to bear the strokes of the cane which were a prelude to the blessing the “father” would have bestowed upon him.
    It is the stupid and simple folks that enrich the purses of quacks. The Illustrated World Encyclopaedia states: “Many people honestly believe in spiritualism. Unfortunately, there have been many professional magicians and others who use trickery to make themselves appear to be mediums.” (Emphasis ours)
    “Surely Die”
    Now, turning to the Holy Bible the belief that “the human personality continues to exist after death” and that there can be communication between the living and the dead, is without foundation; it is devilish, and true Christians discard it.
    God commanded Adam in the Garden of Eden that he must not eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, “for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.” (Genesis 2: 17) It is quite clear that to “surely die” means to cease to exist, pure and simple. But Satan, in his characteristic opposition to God, went subtly to Eve, Adam’s wife, in the guise of a serpent and deceived her saying: “Ye shall not surely die”. This was a blatant lie which gave “the mother of all living” a false hope and led her to sin.
    Concerning the devil, Jesus Christ said: “When he (Satan) speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own; for he is a liar, and the father of it.” (John 8: 44) In his efforts to sustain his lie, the devil whose disposition for deceit had earned him the notorious title of SERPENT, has been influencing the thoughts of men into thinking and believing that when a man dies, he is not completely dead. Also to this end, he with the assistance of the demons has been working in men to event unfounded dogmas and warped notions about the dead, and to inspire bad dreams, false visions, hallucinations, and such like.
    The truth of the Bible is that when a man dies, (the breath of life having left him) he is completely out of existence. He does NOT take any other form or shape nor does he go anywhere to live. He is absolutely unconscious and is turned to nothing: “Vanity of vanities,” said the Preacher, “all is vanity.” The next stage according to God’s promise is RESURRECTION – and then the dead rose shall be judged. Said St. Paul: “And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment.” – Hebrews 9: 27.
    Abel
    Some people sometimes refer to St. Paul’s statement about Abel at Hebrews 11: 4, that “he (Abel) being dead yet speaketh”. This does not mean that Abel was talking after his death. Rather the apostle was explaining how by Abel’s illustrious example of faith, which made him offer a better sacrifice than Cain, he is being spoken of up till today as a righteous man to teach people about faith in God and the doing of things that are pleasing in His sight. The paraphrased epistles, LIVING LETTERS, by Kenneth N. Taylor, renders the text thus: “It was by faith that Abel obeyed God and brought an offering that pleased God more than Cain’s offering did. God accepted Abel and proved it by accepting his gift; and though Abel is long dead, we can still learn from him about trusting God.”
    Witch of Endor
    Another account in the Bible often cited by certain people to show that the living can talk with the dead is the story at 1 Samuel 28: 3-25, about King Saul and the witch of Endor. At that time, Samuel the prophet was dead and had been buried in Ramah, his own city. And Saul the King drove out of the land all the witches and wizards.
    But Saul because of his unfaithfulness was not in favour with God and the Philistines had marshalled their forces and were set to war against Israel. As Saul saw the host of the enemies, he was troubled in heart for fear. And when he enquired of the Lord there was no answer, “neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets”. It was in this desperate state that Saul went to consult a witch. Shame to him! In order that he might not be recognised by the witch who was one of those ousted from Israel, he had to disguise himself by changing his royal robes. He went to the woman in the night – yes, the dark night is most suitable for this sort of dirty, shameful and ungodly business.
    Saul requested her to use her witchcraft power to bring up Samuel so that he might consult the dead prophet in regard to the war of the Philistines. When the woman under demoniacal influence divined, Samuel who was purported to have been raised was not seen by Saul. What he did was to ask the witch: “For what sawest thou?’. And she answered: “I saw gods ascending out of the earth.” (Verse 13) The dialogue continued. “And he said unto her, what form is he of? And she said, an old man cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and bowed himself.” (Verse 14)
    It does not even require a specialised knowledge of the Bible for any clear headed person to know from the narrative that the whole affair was under the command of an enemy of God – Satan the devil. In the first place, Saul himself testified, “God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams.” (Verse 15) And secondly, by going to consult a witch he was contravening the law of God which said: “Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the Lord your God.” – Leviticus 19: 31; see also Deuteronomy 18: 9-12.
    Devil’s Tricks
    Moreover, Saul did not see the so- called Samuel; he merely “PERCEIVED” from the woman’s description that it was he. And the witch herself said that she saw “gods”. How could Samuel alone turn to be gods? There lie the tricks of the devil, which are frequently manifested in the works of sorcerers and all kinds of demon possessed characters.
    The fact is that it was not Samuel that came up but demons that put up the appearance of an old man like Samuel. They are also known as “seducing spirits”, and it is they that impersonate the dead and make appearances or sounds that are seen or heard by spiritualists. St. Paul stated that Satan as well as his visible and invisible agents could change himself into an angel of light but that in the end all of them would get every bit of punishment their wicked deeds deserved. – 2 Corinthians 11: 13-15; see also 1 Timothy 4: 1; Revelation 16: 13, 14.
    Since it was made clear that God had forsaken Saul and refused to answer to his inquiries either “by dreams or by prophets”, there is no ground, therefore, to believe that Samuel, a faithful prophet of God who was already dead, could come back to be a party to the sins of the apostate Saul.
    By the way, why is it that any communication between the living and the dead is never through any genuine prophet of God but through witches, wizards, occultists and what have you? The plain truth is that the idea or practice did not originate from God. And the Lord warned: “And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and mutter: should not a people seek unto their God? for the living to the dead? To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word (God’s word), it is because there is no light in them.” – Isaiah. 8:19, 20.
    Christian Hope
    To show that the dead are absolutely unconscious and that they cannot be in communion with the living, the Psalmist declared: “For in death there is no remembrance of Thee (God): in the grave who shall give Thee thanks?” “Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help. His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.” – Psalm 6:5; 146:3, 4; see also Psalm 30: 9; Isaiah 38: 18, 19.
    What is more, King Solomon stated: “For the living know that they shall die; but the dead know not anything, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten. Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished…whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.” – Ecclesiastes 9: 5-6, 10.
    We advise you, dear reader, not to go to those people who are parading themselves as diviners or spiritualists when you are in trouble or in need of anything. Please, turn to God Almighty and pray to Him. If you earnestly pray with faith, and exercise patience, God the Merciful and Gracious Father will certainly grant you the desire of your heart. (Proverb 10: 24; Matthew 21: 22; Philippians 4: 6) God Himself said:
                               “Look unto me, and be ye saved,
                                   all the ends of the earth:  for
                                     I am God, and there is none
                                           else.”- Isaiah 45: 22.
    
    On the whole, the highlight of the Christian hope about the dead is the consoling, divine promise of resurrection. And until the resurrection takes place the dead must remain silent and unconscious in the grave, and no one living can talk with them. Read Job. 14: 13-15; Psalm 115: 17; John 5: 28, 29.`,

    content:`THE Most High God having purposed to distinguish His people who worshipped Him from those who did not, instituted circumcision as a token of the covenant between Him and Abraham – the father of the Jewish nation. In process of time the gentile nations made in inroad into this erstwhile exclusive custom of the Jews and corrupted it. And so, Christianity, which is practised by spiritual Jews, does not lay emphasis on the physical circumcision but on the spiritual one.
    Circumcision is the act of cut- ting off the foreskin of a man. It is a practice which the Almighty God enjoined upon Abraham and his descendants. The rule was that a male child should be circumcised when he was eight days old. To Abraham, God said: “This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised. And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you. And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations…” – Genesis 17: 10-12.
    God was so strict about it that He ruled that every uncircumcised male child should be cut off from his people for having broken His covenant. – Genesis 17: 14.
    On the selfsame day that God spoke to Abraham, he took Ishmael, his son, who was 13 years old and all other males in his house- hold and circumcised them. Also, he, who was then 99 years old, had himself circumcised in obedience to the Lord’s instruction. – Genesis 17: 23-27.
    Since that time of Abraham, circumcision has not only become a necessary condition of Jewish nationality but also an act in which the Hebrews take particular glory. When Jesus Christ was born, he too was circumcised the eighth day. (Luke 2: 21) Other nations whose males were not circumcised were regarded by the Jews as unclean people otherwise known as the gentiles. Thus uncircumcision became synonymous, by implication, with heathenism, paganism or infidelity.
    Women Circumcision
    As time went on, certain other nations borrowed the Jewish custom of circumcision and so corrupted it that even their women were circumcised contrary to God’s ordinance.
    In this country, it is a common practice among certain ethnic groups or tribes to circumcise their female children. Some do it at a very early age and others circumcise their daughters at their adolescence or when they have attained their majority. So, the custom varies from tribe to tribe.
    There are some tribes that attach more importance to the circumcision of women than they attach to that of men. They have a set time when girls who have attained a certain standard of age are circumcised every year. It is an occasion that is associated with heathenish ceremonies including the worship of ancestors and the appeasing of the “gods” by way of offering sacrifices so that any danger may be averted during the circumcision of the girls.
    At this time whole towns are set in festive mood. The rich parents spend more than enough on the circumcision of their daughters only to demonstrate that the families are well-to-do. Some poor parents have to owe debts in order to make sure that their families, too, ‘do not fall below the average mark. On the part of the husbands of some of the circumcised girls, they also make a show of their affluence – which is to be assessed by the number of pieces of cloths, blouses, headdresses, chemise, shoes, trinkets of jewels, gold or silver, cosmetics, utensils and everything else one can think of for the use of women. Extravagance is even too mild a word fit to be used in describing what the people do on that occasion.
    But on the whole, what do they gain? Nothing, but vainglory! No wonder that some families are gripped with sorrow because of financial entanglements after all the hilarious enjoyments.
    There is a common belief among some of the pagans that a woman cannot be productive except she is circumcised. This springs from superstition, and it is a lie. It accounts for the fanaticism with which some people hold to the tradition of women circumcision, and it is because of this belief they regard those who oppose the practice as potential foes.
    Dangerous
    We must say that the circumcision of women is dangerous and very unscriptural. As a result of it some people had untimely lost their daughters or had they deformed for life. It is an unnecessary exercise which medical experts have advised against.
    In the issue of July 20, 1960, of the defunct Nigerian Daily Service, the “Daily Service Doctor” stated: “Chinyere is a thirteen-day-old child. A few days ago she was brought into my hospital by the parents who were all shouting and crying at the same time as this was their first child. The child was bleeding…What are the facts of the case? Twelve days after the birth of the child, the parents took her to an old woman to be circumcised. The old woman performed her ‘crude- surgery’ and immediately after the operation the child began to bleed heavily. They had to rush the child to me and but for a timely action on my part, the child would have died of haemorrhage.”
    The doctor was writing under the caption, “CIRCUMCISION IS DANGEROUS”. After outlining some biological aspects of women, which make their circumcision dangerous, he concluded: “Female circumcision is therefore unnecessary…It is about time our people stop this primitive female circumcision.” (Emphasis ours)
    Recently, the nursing sister in a Lagos Hospital strongly advised against female circumcision. She described clearly what circumcision in female consists of, and went on to show the complications involved in it. She made it known that “it might result in some gynecological conditions later on in life” She further stated: “I think nature should not be interfered with in this respect. The public in general should be educated on this subject and the ethnic and religious groups who indulge in this practice should be educated on this subject and discouraged from performing this operation in females,” (Sunday Times, November, 17, 1968,)
    Experience and events do justify these medical views, There was a case of a girl who turned neither man nor woman after circumcision, The matter was reported to have been investigated by the Criminal Investigation Department of the Nigerian Police, Warri, and taken to the Magistrate’s Court where a charge of “negligent act causing harm” to a girl was preferred against an old woman, This was published in the front page of the Mid- West Echo, issue of Tuesday, June 21, 1960, The newspaper reported: “Medical examination performed by the medical officer in charge of the Warri General Hospital claimed that ??? has been rendered sexless, due to what the doctor described as ‘mal-circumcision’,” (Ellipsis ours)
    It is sad to note that some people who call themselves Christians do not only subscribe to the idea of women circumcision but do put it into practice, No one can show from the Bible that God’s people ever circumcised a woman, When God instituted circumcision as earlier explained in this sermon, He did not include women. He told Abraham: “Every MAN child (not woman child) among you shall be circumcised,” – Genesis 17: 10.
    The argument of some that circumcision is a custom of the people does not justify the practice. The laws of God transcend all man-made customs or traditions. There- fore any custom that is contrary to the will of God must be thrown away by true Christians. God’s people are warned against heathenish customs. – Jeremiah 10: 2,3.
    Heart Circumcision
    Right from the time of Moses the prophet, God indicated that though the Jews were circumcised in the flesh, there was need yet for them to be circumcised in their hearts so that they might truly “love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live”. – Deuteronomy 10: 16; 30: 6.
    In the days of the early apostles of Jesus Christ, the question of circumcision aroused considerable controversy when certain Judaising teachers said to the gentle converts, “Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved”. To all intents and purposes, this teaching was subversive of genuine Christianity, and so Paul and Barnabas disputed and opposed it. – Acts 15: 1-5.
    When the matter was discussed in the assembly of the apostles and the elders of the Church at Jerusalem, the decision was reached that it was not necessary for the gentile converts to observe the rite of circumcision. – Acts 15: 6, 22-29.
    We must at this juncture stress that in the Christian era, the circumcision of the flesh is of no spiritual significance. Since the advent of Christianity when the way of salvation was opened to the gentiles, the lit era circumcision ceased to be a mark of distinction by which Abraham’s spiritual children are to be identified. What is important now is the spiritual circumcision which is a true conversion of the heart, faith in God and the keeping of His commandments.
    St. Paul stated: “For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision ….. For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh: but he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.” – Romans 2: 25-29.
    Faith
    Today, there are many people that have been circumcised in the flesh – both among the natural Jews and non-Jews alike – who do not believe in Christianity nor have faith in God. Such ones are not spiritually circumcised and they cannot be saved. On this score, St. Paul declared: “Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.” “For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision: but faith which worketh by love.”– 1 Corinthians 7: 19; Galatians 5: 2-3,6; 6: 12-16.
    We can understand, therefore, that neither circumcision in the flesh nor uncircumcision has anything to do with our salvation. It is a person who repents of his sins, fears God and serves Him with faith in the true church organisation, which preaches the truth of Christ unadulteratedly, that is spiritually circumcised; and it is such that will obtain life eternal in God’s Kingdom of end- less bliss. Said St. Paul: “For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh.” (Philippians 3: 3) Furthermore, he exhorted the Christians to be constant in the faith of Christ, and added: “In whom (Christ) also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ.” – Colossians 2: 11.
    In closing, we exhort you to be truly circumcised in your hearts so that you may worship the Lord in truth. It does not matter which nation or race or tribe you hail from, because God is no respecter of persons. In every nation he that fears Him and does His will is accepted by Him. – Acts 10: 34, 35: Romans 4: 9-12.
    May the Lord bless His upon your hearts. Amen.`,

    content:`THE date of the birth of Jesus would not have been a subject of controversy if the churches of Christendom had been consistent in telling their adherents the truth of the matter. That Christmas is a pagan festival with an unseemly Christian veneer or covering is a glaring fact of the Scripture and history.
    In The Explanatory Catechism of Christian Doctrine, it is stated in answer to Questions 50 and 51, that our Saviour Jesus Christ was born at Bethlehem on Christmas Day, the 25th of December. But how the churches came about this date, no one cares to ask. The erroneous belief that the priests and catechists cannot lie makes the churchgoers accept this teaching with quiet contentment. The people therefore go all out to celebrate Christmas NOT out of a scripturally grounded faith but because they so were bred. 
    A true Christian does not do a thing simply because the whole world or majority esteem it highly and do it. Before he does anything, he must first of all satisfy himself that it is in accord with the will of God as revealed in the Holy Scripture. Christ himself said: “…For that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.” – Luke 16: 15. 
    After a diligent research into both sacred and profane history, we have no doubt in our minds that Jesus Christ was born in the month of October, and NOT in December!
    We must at this stage point out that the day, month or year in which Christ was born is not positively stated chapter and verse in the Bible for the unlearned or those who do not search the Scriptures to understand. But there are scriptural records including the Bible Chronology from which we can show to those with open minds that his birth took place in October. 
    Bible Account
    In those days there were appointed 24 Jewish priests, the sons of Aaron, to serve in the temple in a year. Everyone officiated according to the order of his course or turn – two every month. The first priest served from the beginning of the first month called Nisan or Abib and retired at the middle of the month; and the second took over from the middle to the end of the month. The priest Abijah served in the eighth course according to 1 Chronicles 24: 1-10. The eighth course started from the middle to the end of the fourth month known as Tammuz, which, according to the Jewish Calendar, corresponds with the latter part of our June to early July. (Vide The Oxford Encyclopedic Concordance, page 197, and The Universal Bible Dictionary by Buckland & Williams, page 475.) 
    Zacharias, the father of John the Baptist, was a successor of Abijah. It was when he was officiating in the temple in the order of his turn – “the course of Abijah” – that an angel of God appeared to him saying that his wife, Elizabeth, would bear him a son to be named John. (Luke 1: 5-13) After the completion of Zacharias’ period of duty in early July (Tammuz), his wife became pregnant, and she hid herself for five months. – Luke 1: 23, 24. 
    In the sixth month of Elizabeth’s conception – Chisleu, which is our December – the angel Gabriel was sent by God to the virgin Mary and he announced to her that she would conceive and bear a son to be called JESUS. The angel added:  “And behold, thy cousin, Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren. For with God nothing shall be impossible.” – Luke 1: 26-31,36,37. 
    Consequent upon the annunciation Mary, no doubt, was in high spirits. With haste she went straight to a city in the uplands of Judah to meet Elizabeth. She stayed with her cousin about three months (i.e. from January to March) and then returned home. (Luke 1: 39-40, 56) Something dramatic occurred when Mary visited Elizabeth. As soon as she entered Zacharias’ house and greeted Elizabeth, the babe (John) stirred in her womb. The words of Elizabeth to Mary at that instance, which were motivated by the Holy Spirit, show clearly that Mary herself was already pregnant. Not only did Elizabeth bless the fruit of her womb but she went on to address her out right as “the mother of my Lord”. – Luke 1: 41-44. 
    According to medical authorities the span of foetal life under normal condition is 280 days, which is nine months; any time in the tenth month the child, by God’s grace, can be born. This was the case with John the Baptist. The angel appeared to Mary in the sixth month of Elizabeth’s conception and Mary went to her and stayed three months: six plus three equal nine. It was then “Elisabeth’s full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son” – obviously, in the tenth month, April. – Luke 1: 36,56-57. 
    Having been equipped with this knowledge, let us now count Mary’s conception from that January as was manifest in Elizabeth’s declaration, we will arrive at September as the ninth month; then in the tenth month OCTOBER, Jesus Christ was born. But on which day in October his birth took place no one can tell because there is no record. We of the GKS say only what we can prove. 
    With regard to the year of Christ’s birth, historians disagree with one another. Some hold to B.C. 2 or B. C. 4, and others suggest B.C. 6. We are no historians, and so we do not wish to be entangled in their disagreements. But from a scrutiny of historical records B.C. 2 is more acceptable to many. 
    Physical Facts
    The physical features of Palestine in regard to the climate lend support to the view that Christ was not born in December. According to the Gospel story, there were shepherds attending their flocks in the open fields by night when Christ was born. This could not have been possible in December, because all accredited authorities agree that December, which corresponds with the Jewish ninth month, Chisleu, (Zechariah 7: 1) was usually a time of winter in Palestine when the people could not stay outside in the night owing to the intense cold. The Oxford Encyclopedic Concordance states that there: was “snow on the mountains”. 
    But October is the Jewish seventh month called Tisri or Ethanim. (1 Kings 8: 2) It was a time of normal weather that permitted of outdoor or outside activities.  Again, the fact that the churches of Christendom observe the death of Jesus Christ (“Good Friday”) in April, confirms that his birth could not have taken place in December. Of a truth, he was killed in April, which is Nisan or Abib, the first month of the Jewish year, when the Feast of Passover or Unleavened Bread was celebrated. 
    We all agree that Jesus Christ lived for 33 1/2 years. Now let us admit that he was born in December as the churches teach, it will mean, therefore, that his 33rd birthday anniversary fell on December, and six months later, which was June, he died. If it was so, why then are the churches celebrating his death in April and not in June? The plain truth is that he was born in October. His 33rd birthday then fell on October, and six months later, that is, in April, he was slain. 
    Historical Facts
    There is no authentic history in existence that gives support to the teaching that Jesus Christ was born in December. We challenge anyone who may argue this to cite a SINGLE authority to the contrary to prove us wrong. There was no such festival as Christmas until the fourth century, and it was the Romish Church in its characteristic tendency of “meeting Paganism half-way”, that just fixed on December 25 as Christ’s birthday. We shall dwell on this point later on in this sermon. 
    Earl W. Count, in his book, 4000 Years of Christmas, stated that “December twentyfifth is no more the historical date of His (Christ’s) birth than is any other”. He added: “The Christians chose it to be His birthday only several centuries after he had lived and died.” (Page 34).
    We cannot do without making reference to the evidence of the well-known ecclesiastical historian, Alexander Hislop. In his distinguished work, The Two Babylons, he wrote: “There is not a word in the Scriptures about the precise day of His (Christ’s) birth…What is recorded there, implies that at what time soever His birth took place, it could not have been on the 25th of December… The cold of the night, from December to February, is very piercing, and it was not the custom for the shepherds of Judea to watch their flocks in the open fields later than about the end of October. It is in the last degree incredible, then, that the birth of Christ could have taken place at the end of December.” (Pages 91-92, emphasis ours) 
    On this point there is great unanimity among commentators who include Barnes, Doddridge, Lightfoot, Joseph Scaliger, Joseph Mede, and Jennings, in his Jewish Antiquities. After a comprehensive disquisition on the subject, among other argument, Joseph Mede adduced the following: “At the birth of Christ every woman and child was to go to be taxed at the city whereto they belonged, whither some had long journeys; but the middle of winter was not fitting for such a business especially for women with child, and children to travel in. Therefore, Christ could not be born in the depth of winter…”(MEDE’S Works, 1672). 
    Hislop also quoted Gill as stating in his Commentary on Luke 2: 8 thus: “The first rain falls in the month Marchesvan, which answers to the latter part of our October and the former part of November…From whence it appears that Christ must be born before the middle of October, since the first rain was not yet come.” (The Two Babylons, pages 91-92).
    “No date is more unlikely for the birth of Christ than the twenty-fifth of December; but it was the birthday of Mithra…” This was stated by E. E. Kellett in his A Short History of Religions. And Professor Cecil John Cadoux, M.A., D.D., D.Litt. Professor” of Church History at Mansfield College, in his book The Life of Jesus, wrote: “There are no grounds for thinking that He (Jesus) was born in December.” 
    Furthermore, the Illustrated World Encyclopedia has this to say: “Our calendar, by which we reckon the days, months, and years, is dated from the first year after the birth of Jesus. We call this the Christian Era. But as we study and read, we will learn that  Jesus was not really born on the 25th of December…” (Vol. 5, page 1194).
    Roman Catholic Confession
    It is heartening to note that at long last both the Roman Catholic and Protestant Churches of Christendom have openly admitted that Jesus Christ was not actually born on the 25th of December. It can be recalled that for this veracious view on which the God’s Kingdom Society took her stand since her inception, he has been subjected to persecutions of one sort or another. 
    Concerning the date of Christ’s birth, The Catholic Voice of December 1956, has the following to say: “The 25th. Dec., the present feast of Christmas has a longstanding tradition, but it is likely that in the beginning it was simply fixed on one of the great public holidays of the civil year and probably one that was originally a pagan feast”! (Page 179-180, emphasis ours).
    In answer to a question as to how the Roman Catholics managed to know from Holy Scripture that Jesus was born on December 25th, The Catholic Voice, issue of July 1962, states: “The Gospels do not mention any date for the birth of Christ. We do not know the date of Christ’s birth, not even the year in which He was born,” (Emphasis ours) But may we pause to ask: If they do not know the date of Christ’s birth, why do they categorically and dogmatically state in the Catechism and other books that Jesus Christ was born on December 25? Is this not inconsistency? The Catholic Voice continues, “We celebrate the feast of Christ’s birth on the 25th of December, at least in the Western Church. The Eastern Catholic Church celebrates the same feast on the 6th of January. These dates are not based on historical evidence of the exact date of Christ’s birth…” (Emphasis ours) 
    Protestant Admission
    The following piece extracted from “A Christmas Sermon” by a Protestant Pastor, which was published in the African Challenge of December 1959, speaks for itself: .. Was Jesus born on December 25? In fairness to the critics who ask this question, it must be admitted that although we know the year” (unlike the Roman Catholics that do not know the year) “the exact day of the birth of the Lord Jesus Christ is not known…Long before Christ was born, December 25 had been the time for a noisy pagan festival in honour of the god of the sun, In time, however, the Church substituted Christmas for the old pagan festival with the view of turning the minds of the heathen to the true living God” 
    The reason of the Church for changing the date of Christ’s birth, as given by the Pastor, is flimsy. It is not by changing the birthday of Christ to that day of a pagan carnival that would win people to Christ. Rather it would lead to more ungodliness, and that is why up till today Christmas is still; defaced with pagan marks.
    Christmas is Paganism
    “That Christmas was originally a Pagan festival is beyond all doubt,” stated Alexander Hislop. “The time of the year, and the ceremonies with which it is still celebrated, prove its origin,” he added. (The Two Babylons, page 93) Concerning Christmas, E. E. Kellett wrote: “No one can doubt that it has many pagan characters; and indeed this is why it was totally rejected by some Dissenting Churches.” (A Short History of Religions). 
    The GKS has always held that there is nothing in the celebration of Christmas that reflects the teaching or character of Jesus Christ, or portrays the glory of God. The “Christmas Editorial” of the African Challenge of December 1959, vindicates our view. It states in part: “Christ, the matchless Saviour of mankind, would undoubtedly be grieved by the way the world celebrates His traditional birthday. The world as well as those who are Christians by name celebrate Christmas with great jubilation at the expense of worship…The Christmas season is increasingly becoming a time for most business people to make more money. The most profitable season of the year for nearly all shops is the Christmas season, when the public is enticed: ‘Do your Christmas shopping early!’ Another thing that robs us of the meaning of Christmas is traditionalism… Do not some even join pagan customs with their Christmas celebrations?” Please let people ponder these things and stop deceiving themselves.
    If there is any season when the Police at most have a restless time in the year, it is the Christmas season. If there is any period when more cases of crimes, accidents and deaths are reported in the year, it is the same notorious Christmas season. 
    The acts of lawlessness and hooliganism that always characterize its celebration are but sure proofs that it is an unchristian affair. It is a time when people eat and drink in excess. Some disfigure themselves with all sorts of masks, carry about dreadful images and others paint their faces and run amok like crazy people to do havoc and disturb the peace of responsible people. How can the Christian mind imagine that all these abominations are done to honour the Son of God, Jesus Christ the Righteous who is the Prince of Peace? It is unthinkable!
    This sermon does not warn you against celebrating the birthday of Christ at the spiritually appropriate time and in a Christian manner to the glory of God. St. Paul advised that God should be served in the way acceptable to Him. – Hebrews 12: 28. 
    
    The vanity of Christmas has been exposed enough. History condemns it. The Holy Bible, which is the law book and guide for all true Christians, does not justify it. A word is enough for the wise.  And Christ says, “He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.”`, 
    title:"WAS CHRIST BORN ON CHRISTMAS DAY?"},
 {key:16, 
    content:`ONE of the most important festivals that God ordained for His true worshippers to celebrate in this age of international distress and perplexity, the Last Day, is the Feast of Tabernacles. Yet it is the one most of those who profess to be Christians treat with utmost neglect.
    The Feast of Tabernacles is an annual festival that was instituted by the Almighty God since the days of Moses the prophet during the historic journey of the Israelites from Egypt to Canaan. God’s instruction was to the effect that the feast should be celebrated on the 15th day of the seventh month of the Jewish year, and to last eight days. On that occasion the children of Israel were by law enjoined to make offerings to the Lord and to dwell in booths as a memorial of their experience in the wilderness when God made them live in booths under His protection. The ordinance concerning the feast is recorded at Leviticus 23: 33-43.
    God said: “Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto the Lord seven days: on the first day shall be a sabbath, and on the eighth day shall be a sabbath. And ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before the Lord your God seven days it shall be a statute for ever in your generations: ye shall celebrate it in the seventh month. Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites born shall dwell in booths: that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God.” – Leviticus 23: 39-43.
    Ingathering
    Furthermore, in Deuteronomy 16: 13-17, it is written: “Thou shalt observe the feast of tabernacles seven days, after that thou hast gathered in thy corn and thy wine: and thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite, the stranger, and the father- less, and the widow, that are with- in thy gates …and they shall not appear before the Lord empty: every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of the Lord thy God which he hath given thee.”
    No doubt, the Feast of Tabernacles was of great significance to the Jews. It was also known as the Feast of Ingathering for the fact that it was usually celebrated when they had gathered in their crops. – Exodus 23: 16; 34: 22.
    The reading of the law of God to the hearing and understanding of the people was a very important event in the celebration of the feast. This was so because of the sanctifying effect the law was capable of having on the Jews so “that they may learn, and fear the Lord your God”. – Deuteronomy 31: 10-13.
    When the Jews returned from Babylonish captivity and resettled in Canaan, there was an occasion when they gathered together and caused the book of the law of God to be read to the hearing of all of them. It was on the second day of that occasion when “the chief of the fathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levites” were assembled before Ezra, the scribe, so as to under- stand the words of the law, that they came across the ordinance of the Feast of Tabernacles. As it is written:
    “And they found written in the law which the Lord had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month: and that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth unto the mount, and fetch olive branches, and pine branches, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is written.”
    Following this discovery from the law book, the people went all out to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles with great jubilation. The grandeur of the occasion was tremendous, and the rejoicing of the celebrants was so much that Nehemiah recorded that “since the days of Jeshua (Joshua) the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so”. The prophet then stated: “And there was very great gladness. Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according unto the manner.”- Nehemiah 8: 14-18.
    Spiritual Jews
    Some people argue that the Feast of Tabernacles has nothing to do with Christianity and that it was meant for the Jews alone. They therefore ask whether we of the GKS are Jews.
    What many people do not know is the fact that there are spiritual Jews as there are natural Jews. The natural Jews are those who are Abraham’s children in the flesh – that is, by the circumstance of birth. They are supposed to be the worshippers of God like Abraham their fleshly father, but the pity of it is that some of them, today, neither believe in God nor in Jesus Christ as the Saviour. On the other hand, the spiritual Jews are those who become the children of Abraham by faith notwithstanding their place of birth or origin. In this Christian Era, it is the spiritual Jews – not those in the flesh – that are acknowledged as the “Israel of God” or the children of God. – Romans 9: 6-8; Galatians 6: 12-16.
    Said St. Paul: “For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh: but he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.” (Romans 2: 28, 29) He further said: “Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham…So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.” – Galatians 3: 7-9.
    Anyone who has a vivid understanding of the Scriptures as shown in the foregoing explanation, will not ask as to whether we are Jews. Indeed, we are spiritual Jews and so too are other persons who are of the Abrahamic faith and who worship God in truth as ordained by Him through Jesus Christ. In fact, anyone who is a true Christian is a spiritual Jew.
    Christ’s Participation
    It is of great interest to note that Jesus Christ, the Founder of Christianity, celebrated the Feast of Tabernacles and thus set the pace for his followers. The occasion afforded him a good opportunity to discharge his functions as a great teacher of truth- “a Minister of the Sanctuary, and of the true Tabernacle”. – Hebrew 8: 1, 2.
    The record of St. John about Christ’s participation in the celebration of the feast is as clear as it is fascinating. He stated that when the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles was close at hand, the brothers of Jesus Christ asked him to go to Judea for the feast so that his disciples might see his works. They portrayed him as one who sought to publicise himself and so they urged him derisively to go and “shew thyself to the world”. – John 7: 2-4.
    Some people ignorantly argue that those brothers of Jesus were his disciples. No, they were not. It is clearly written in verse 5 that “neither did his brethren believe in him”. They were his brothers in the flesh being the children of Mary.
    Jesus was a man with a mission and so he always took care to guard against the machinations of his enemies who hated him for exposing their evil deeds and whose desire was to make his mission a failure. Therefore, he told his brothers that the right time for him to go to the feast had not yet come. He added: “The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.” – Verses 6-8.
    After his brothers had gone to the feast, “then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as It were in secret”. This he did because the wicked Jews looked for a chance to kill him. But when the festival was half over, he no longer hid himself neither did he conceal his identity any more, rather he entered the temple and taught a vast multitude the doctrine of God. And when the Jews expressed astonishment at his learning and Intelligence, he declared: “My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me. – Verses 10-17.
    On the last and great day of the feast, Jesus Christ was very conspicuous in view of the active part he played. With great enthusiasm and earnestness, and in his characteristic convincing clearness, Christ directed a soul-saving message to all peoples of the earth. As it is written: “In the last day; that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink. He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.” – Verses 37, 38.
    From the foregoing, it is abundantly clear that Jesus Christ celebrated the Feast of Tabernacles, and it is nothing short of unfaithfulness, therefore, for any of his disciples to refrain from following the example of Our Lord and Saviour by celebrating the feast.
    Watchtower Society
    The controversy in regard to the Feast of Tabernacles sparked off by the members of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society in the forties is still fresh in our memory. They criticised the GKS for observing the feast and contended that Jesus Christ did not take part in its celebration. But in 1950, the “Jehovah’s witnesses” in Nigeria were covered with shame when the hierarchy of their organisation in the United States published an article captioned, “THE REAL FEAST OF INGATHERING UNDER WAY”, in the Watchtower magazine issue of July I, 1950.
    The Watchtower has the following to say: “The apostle John gives an account of Jesus’ attendance at the feast of tabernacles, and of the things he said and did, which leads us to the conclusion that this visit was a very important one; and so we find it to be in showing the importance of the feast of tabernacles … The reading of the law at the feast of tabernacles was for the instruction of the people. The religious leaders of the Jews were looking for Jesus at this time, to kill him. In view of this fact some might ask, why did Jesus expose himself publicly? He here began the fulfillment of this type. He was teaching the truth to those that would hear, thus showing them the way of life and happiness. There the type began to be fulfilled.”
    In spite of all this, the members of the Watchtower Society are still confused about the significance of the feast in our time!
    Prophetic Instruction
    Although the precedent set by Jesus Christ is enough to guide us Christians, there is a definite prophetic instruction to the effect that the worshippers of God in these last days in which we live should celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles. As it is written: “And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem (God’s Kingdom organization – Rev. 21: 2) shall even go up from year to year to worship the King, the Lord of hosts and to keep the feast of tabernacles. And it shall be, that whoso will not come up of all the families of the earth unto worship the King, the Lord of host, even upon them shall be no rain (rain means the Lord’s blessing). And if the family of Egypt (Egypt here means spiritually, the ungodly) go not up, and come not, that have no rain; there shall be the plague, wherewith the Lord  will smite the heathen that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.  This shall be the punishment of Egypt (the ungodly), and the punishment of all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.” – Zechariah 14: 16-19.
    This prophecy was not meant to fulfil in the days of the prophets of old but in this last days of this evil world when all nations irrespective of race, colour or tribe are called to worship the Almighty Father through Jesus Christ. But we must point out that Christians are not to observe the letters of the law but the spirit of it which gives life. (2 Corinthians 3: 5,6) In view of this, we are not bound to keep the feast in the seventh month but at any chosen time as the Lord’s spirit directs (and we observe it this year, December 15-22). And so too we do not make burnt offerings since Jesus Christ, the antitypical lamb, had been sacrificed for mankind once and for all. (John 1: 29; 1 Corinthians 5: 7; Hebrews 10: 5-12). However, we do offer spiritual sacrifice – “the sacrifice of praise to God” through the preaching of His word, giving of thanks and so forth.- Hebrew 13: 15.
    In the light of the scriptural authorities adduced in this sermon, readers who are unbiased and are of goodwill will appreciate why the God’s Kingdom Society celebrates the feast annually. And for keeping the feast commandment, we have always enjoyed with thanks, the blessings symbolized by rain which the Lord promised to pour upon the celebrants of the Feast of Tabernacles. – Zechariah 14: 16, 17; Ezekiel 34: 26; 1 John 3: 22.`, 
    title:"THE FEAST OF TABERNACLES"},
 {key:17, 
    content:`AT this time that the year is rolling away, it is customary with people of sober minds and responsibility to make fresh resolutions aimed at guiding their actions, improving their habits and making the most of their lives in the New Year.
    On this score, the message of the President of God’s Kingdom society (GKS), Brother E. T. Otomewo, to the Churches of Christ during the celebration of the Christian Feast of Tabernacles, which ended last Sunday, is very timely indeed. The message captioned, Beware of What You Sow in Life, provides enough recipe for everyone who reckons with God in his life, to make good resolutions.
    Following is the full text of the message:
    Members and Friends,
    HAIL JEHOVAH AND CHRIST JESUS!
    As I stated in my Freedom Day Message in October this year – particularly in the interest of the non-members who joined us in fellowship – we of the GKS, as of faith, HAIL JEHOVAH AND CHRIST JESUS instead of mortal men because it is They alone that can truly protect and save. – Psalm 3: 8; Jeremiah 17: 5,7; Isaiah 45: 22; Daniel 3: 28, 29; Acts 4: 10-12; Revelation 7: 9, 10. Some hailed Hitler, the dictator, during World War II, believing that he was their saviour. But he was unable to save them and so Jeremiah 17: 5 which says, “Cursed is the man that trusteth in man” fulfilled to a great extent on his blind followers. In our human dealings, we can trust or repose confidence in men who are sincere, honest and GODLY but in so far as deliverance or salvation is concerned, it is God alone through Jesus Christ that we who are Christians should look to. This is why we HAIL JEHOVAH AND CHRIST JESUS!
    Why We Gather
    Earlier, notice was given that as from December 15-22, the GKS and other believers in Christ would celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles all over the world. We are therefore assembled here this day for this purpose – that is, to celebrate the Christian Feast of Tabernacles.
    Before dwelling on the subject of my Message for this occasion, let me just refresh your memories in short, of what the Feast is. It is a yearly festival ordained by Jehovah the Creator of the world. – Leviticus 23: 33-43. It is to be celebrated by every worshipper of God so that he may be protected and prospered. And the Jews did celebrate it as was ordained by God in those days.
    When Jesus Christ, the founder of Christianity, came he too celebrated it as an example for his disciples to follow, and that is why true Christians celebrate it today. – John 7: 1-18, 37, 38; 13: 15. And God had warned through Zechariah, His prophet, that the remnant of His people in this last day in which we live, should celebrate the Feast and that those who did not would be punished with plague. – Zechariah 14: 16-19. The foregoing scriptural authorities are clear enough, and they justify our celebrating the Feast of Tabernacles annually, by the grace of God.
    Whatever a Man Soweth He Shall Reap
    Now, let me turn to the topic of my message: “BEWARE OF WHAT YOU SOW IN LIFE”. There are some people who think that man is in this world to do just what he likes until he quits it at death without giving account of his doings to anyone in this wicked world or in the new world hereafter. They do not believe in the perfect world of God that will soon take the place of this world which is ridden with wickedness. Some of them do not believe in God too! Therefore, they do all sorts of things – good and bad – to their fellow men without care or fear. But by so doing they are sowing seeds which shall grow in to kindred crops or trees, and the fruits of which they shall reap in a DETERMINED TIME that is as certain as day and night. In Proverbs 11: 19, 21, God used Solomon to say:
    “As righteousness tendeth to life: so he that pursueth evil pursueth it to his own death. Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished: but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.”
    From the foregoing quote, it is clear that man, however powerful he may be, will certainly reap what he sows. And there are different ways we sow in this world. We sow by word of mouth and by our acts. If we say good things about God and His work, He takes note of them. He will bless us for so doing even now in this evil world, and fully and everlastingly in His perfect Kingdom of endless bliss. Those who do the opposite, He may punish now but more particularly in the age of the judgment of the dead.
    Moreover, men also sow by word of mouth when they say kindly or unkindly things about other people. Those whom they say them about, may not be able to bless them or take vengeance but their children, relations or even friends may do so and, above all; God who impartially -distributes His blessings among the faithful and also punishes the wicked justly, will certainly act in His own appointed time.
    In view of all this, reasonable and godly people know that by word of mouth and by action or deed-good or bad – they are sowing seeds which they – shall surely reap; and so they TAKE GREAT CARE in what they sow, that is, what they say or do to other people so that they may not reap the vengeance of ungodly men or that of God in the end. I say, “the vengeance of ungodly men” because it is the ungodly that revenge. No man is commissioned by God to take vengeance on his neighbour. The proper thing to do is to go to the law court, if one wishes, to seek redress. It is God alone that is to avenge and He Himself said, “Vengeance is mine.” – Romans 12: 19.
    Some people want to enjoy the good things of life at the expense of their neighbours. They steal from or cheat people to become rich; some acquire wealth, fame and power through oppression, mischief or some other forms of wickedness. In all this, such ones are sowing evil and will CERTAINLY REAP THE FRUITS THEREOF. Those who sow good will reap good and those who sow evil will reap evil. Yes, we shall reap WHATEVER we sow. As it is written:
    “Be not deceived; God is not mocked: FOR WHATSOEVER A MAN SOWETH, THAT SHALL HE ALSO REAP.” – Galatians 6: 7.
    Do not be carried away by your good status in life into talking carelessly and hurtfully to your neighbours. Do no harm to people by your acts. If you do, you shall reap the fruits thereof. You cannot run away from a mightier man than you, the Government of the day and, above all, God Himself, Who will make you EAT the bad fruits of what you sow!
    I said earlier that we should not hurt people by word of mouth. But if you are lawfully placed in a position, spiritual or otherwise to rebuke and even to punish an evil-doer as a measure of discipline, it is understandable, and it does not matter whether the offender’s or sinner’s feelings are hurt or not. God will be pleased, and God-fearing, law-abiding men will appreciate it.
    Haman and Jezebel
    Every wicked person knows that he is wicked. His conscience pricks him when he does evil. He will certainly reap what he sows. Jezebel and Haman are ready instances. Jezebe1 sowed kindred evil seeds – she killed Naboth, ruled her husband contrary to God’s law (Genenis 3: 16) and committed idolatry or spiritual fornication. Indeed, she reaped the fruit of her iniquity. She was thrown from a storey building down to death with her body dismembered; her spattered blood, dogs licked! What an in- glorious death for a queen! Yes, she reaped what she sowed. That was the reward of wickedness. – 1 Kings 21: 23, 24; 2 Kings 9: 30-37.
    Haman also reaped enough of what he sowed. He conspired to kill innocent Jews and set the gallows ready for Mordecai who refused to bow to him because of his faith in God and obedience to His laws. He, Haman, reaped the fruit of his actions. It was he that was hanged instead. – Esther chapter 7; see also Psalm 7: 15, 16.
    True Christians of today who know these things fear God and tremble at His word always. – Proverbs 16: 6; 1 Peter 3: 10-12.
    If the beginning of one’s life is good and prosperous, though by evil means, one should beware. The end may not be good with one. The beginning does not always dictate the end. There was the case of Thomas Paine, the agnostic. He was popular at a stage in his life but at the end he, like Jezebel and Haman, died an ignominious death – “practically deserted by his friends…broken-hearted, unnoticed, unrewarded and unsung”! – Vide the Morning Post, Tuesday, August 20, 1963. That was the end of a worldly intellectual who was an infidel that took pride in blasphemy by word of mouth, by’ his pen, and by conduct. He reaped partially, of course, the fruit of his ungodliness in this evil world. I know of no report that he repented anti served Jesus Christ before he died. He shall therefore be judged by God during the resurrection of the unjust for his opposition to God’s work. – Hebrews 9: 27; Acts 24: 15; Romans 14: 12; 2 Corinthians 5: 10.
    Exhortation
    Let us watch and guard against anything that will be detrimental to our end by sowing good seeds – either by word of mouth or by deeds – so that we may lead a life of contentment and reap peace, happiness and other good things from God in the end. But those who ignore this advice – whether they like it or not – will certainly reap the reward of their iniquities. As it is written:
    “Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.” –  Job 4: 8.
    Finally, I exhort you to support the work of God always by all means at your disposal – your influence, your money, your wisdom with which God has blessed you, your substance and/or possessions and even your body. In so doing, you are sowing righteousness or sowing “to the Spirit”, and you shall, by the grace and power of God, reap everlasting life in His perfect Kingdom as recorded in Galatians 6: 8. See also Proverbs 3: 9, 10.
    I also exhort you to prove yourselves at all times as true Christians in your dealings with your fellow men. Deal with one and sundry in love and be at peace with your neighbours always as recorded in Romans 12: 17 and 18, to wit:
    “Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men. If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.”
    May God be with us all until we meet again to celebrate the Feast in 1969 by His grace and power. And may the Feast of Tabernacles’ blessings parabolically called “rain” in Zechariah 14:16-19, be our portion forever. Amen.`, 
    title:"BEWARE OF WHAT YOU SOW IN LIFE"},

    content:`“WHEN once ‘the love of money’ is allowed to rule in the heart, it becomes the prolific root of all kinds of evil. Every species of impiety, iniquity, and vice, in one way or another, grows from it; and a large proportion of the miseries, as well as the crimes of mankind, originates from the same source.” There is abundance of truth in this piece from Scott’s Commentary.

    We are living in a world where men are engrossed in the pursuit of materialism. Men’s minds are inspired with extravagant passion for wealth and there is over-estimation of money among people of almost all walks of life. It is therefore not uncommon to come across those who say, “I must either get rich at all costs or I die”. Such are the class of people St. Paul described as “men of corrupt minds, .and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness”. But he warned that we should keep away from them. – 1 Timothy 6: 5.
    Let us get it clear straight away that money in itself is not evil but the love of it is a sin.
    Bribery
    In this sermon we wish to expatiate on one of the evils that the love of money has caused to be instilled in the nerves of many people. It is an evil, though not peculiar to our country, that continues to pester our society in spite of public outcry against it. And what is it? BRIBERY!
    Bribery is a gift used corruptly to influence public or official action, or something offered to a person in order to persuade him to do a favour he ought not to do. It is a sin because it is a transgression of the law of God; and according to the laws of the land, it is a criminal offence. Anyone found guilty of it in the law court is exposed to a summary conviction. But then that does not free him from God’s own judgment and punishment EXCEPT he repents and STOPS taking bribes.
    A point we must make clear is that both the receiver and the giver of a bribe are guilty of sin before God. Concerning the judgment of God, Paul the apostle stated that it is not only those who commit sins that are worthy of death but those, too, who aid and abet or have pleasure in or applaud them. (Romans 1: 32) It was on the strength of this understanding he admonished Timothy, his workfellow in the gospel, not to “be partaker of other men’s sins” but to “keep thyself pure”. (1 Timothy 5: 22.) People should therefore refrain from giving or taking bribes.
    In the days of the civilian rule in Nigeria, the obnoxious odour of bribery and corruption stank to the high heavens. This diabolical practice was so widespread that from the office of messengers to that of high officials or the honourables were men who indulged heart and soul in it.
    
    The stage was reached that a young man or woman from college with a School Certificate could hardly get a job unless he or she gave a bribe. In some cases poor applicant girls were carnally defiled by immoral employers – a thing they would not want done to their daughters. The position was such that in most cases employment was not based on the merit of qualification but on the consideration of how much, in cash or kind, was corruptly offered.
    It is sad to note that some on a high scale of salary demand up to £10 or £20 from a poor man who is seeking employment as a “labourer”. Sadder still is the fact that some of these labourers are sacked after working for a space of about three months or so, in order that the heartless bribe-grabbers may create chance to get more bribes. This is to show how callous and avaricious some men are, but God will certainly hear the cry of the poor and needy and plead their cause, so “that the man of the earth may no more oppress”. Yes, “the expectation of the poor shall not perish forever”, and the unrepentant corrupt fellows who oppress and make things difficult for them will be uprooted by God. – Psalm 9: 17, 18; 10: 2-18.
    Anyone who, because of corrupt gain, denies another of his civic right to hold any public office for which he is in every respect qualified, is wicked. He will be justly recompensed by God. “Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished: but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.” – Proverbs 11: 21; see also Isaiah 3: 11.
    There is no record that God had ever dealt kindly with those who oppressed the poor; rather He punished them. Concerning the oppressors and bribe-mongers, God caused His prophet to write: “Forasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the poor, and ye take from him bur- dens of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink wine of them. For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins: THEY AFFLICT THE JUST, THEY TAKE A BRIBE, AND THEY TURN ASIDE THE POOR IN THE GATE FROM THEIR RIGHT…” – Amos 5: 11-13.
    Corruption
    A Judge who takes bribe can be blind to the truth and thus pervert the cause of justice even though he had initially sworn an oath to discharge his duties without partiality, fear or favour. The law of God says: “Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause… And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise, and perverteth the words of the righteous.” (Exodus 23: 6-8) Furthermore it is written: “A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment.” (Proverbs 17: 23) This kind of gift intended to corrupt a person is unlawful but there is nothing wrong in a gift that is an honest expression of charity which is void of a sinful motive.
    A Grade “B” Customary Court Judge was once reported to have been found guilty of “judicial corruption” in a High Court, and was sentenced to two years imprisonment. The presiding Judge, as reported, remarked that “if our Judiciary is corrupt, there is no other safe place in this country”. (Vide the West African Pilot of September 20, 1963)
    The evils of bribery are many. A driver who obtains a driving licence through bribery can constitute a menace on the public highway. A traffic offense overlooked by a policeman because of bribery can lead to a fatal accident. The blood of the victims in such a case is upon the head of that policeman as well as the driver and whoever is a party to that pernicious transaction. They are all accountable to God. Said St. Paul: “So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.” – Romans 14:12.
    Before the eyes of responsible citizens the Police deserve every respect because of the importance of their duties to humanity, and the immense benefit the citizenry derives from their services. But the pity of it is that owing to the love of money and the same mania of get-rich-quick, corruption has insinuated itself into this serviceable department.
    Cases of policemen found guilty of bribery and corruption in the law courts are many. Yet the ungodly ones do not take warning.
    A police-constable was reported to have written a letter to a herbalist requesting that the ‘spirit’ be invoked to protect him so that he could take bribe. The Daily Times, issue of October 8, 1965, published that a first-class constable admitted in the Chief Magistrate’s Court writing a letter in which he requested the spirit to “protect me from the hands of my enemy. I wish to be promoted to the maximum rank in the Nigeria police force by 1968…Give me protection so that I could take bribe while checking on the road”.
    The report added that the policeman “claimed that he was compelled to write it at the cemetery” and that he also went to the house of the herbalist, who was said to be his brother-in-law, to ask for medicine to cure stomach trouble and jaundice”.
    Granted that a fake herbalist had promised all the “sweet nonsense” to a public officer and perhaps given him a dirty ring as an assurance of what the ‘spirit’ could do, we can just imagine what the character of that officer would be in his department.
    The honest and God-fearing members of the Force will be doing a great service to the nation if they do not cover the corrupt ones whenever there is a clue to their criminal acts. It is not only a disgrace but also a betrayal of trust for any constable, who ought to enforce the law, to engage in clandestine corrupt practices. Such ones deserve no sympathy; they must be exposed and brought to book in order to save the good name of the Force and so that it may always command the confidence and respect of the public.
    There are also allegations of bribery in certain hospitals, and it is true that some members of the public induce public servants to take bribes. In the Daily Times of June 18, 1960, it was published that “the Onitsha Branch of the Nigerian Union of Nurses has blamed ‘over anxious’ patients in connection with the allegation that some of the Onitsha General Hospital Staff were being tipped before hospital staff could attend them”, Any hospital staff who takes bribes from “over anxious” patients is himself a disgrace to, his noble humanitarian profession. And is it not true that some nurses are sometimes negligent, or cause delay, and make things difficult for some patients to make them “over anxious” in order to give bribes?
    Awful Disclosure
    The former Chairman of the Nigerian Railway Corporation, Sir Ralf Emerson, admitted before the Elias Commission of Inquiry, that “there was corruption in every establishment, and that his Corporation was no exception”. (Vide the Daily Times of May 26, 1960). Sir Ralf deserved compliments for his frank statement, but we hold the view that the fact that corruption exists in “every establishment” is no ground for any top-man to wink at or take a less serious view of it in his own circle. No reasonable person will steal or throw acid upon himself because foolish people do so. “Act well your part, and there the honour lies.”
    The head of a department who does nothing to resist or eliminate corrupt practices going on under his nose gives room for the inference that he himself is also corrupt.
    In 1963, the Railway and Ports Trans- port Staff Union made an allegation of mal-practices in matters of promotion in the Nigerian Railway Corporation and urged the Federal Minister of Transport to conduct an investigation into it. Following this, the Chairman of the Corporation told the Daily Times: “It is true the union has on a number of occasions made allegations of bribery and corruption but the allegations have never been substantiated.” (Daily Times of Nov. 30, 1963) But the report of the recent probe into the affairs of the Nigerian Railway Corporation but an awful disclosure of stinking corruption affecting some of its very top officials. Some of them have been sacked or barred from holding public offices. (Daily Times, April 20, 1968)
    Before the Military take-over of Government, there were reports that some people left jobs of high salaries for those of low wages all because of the avenue open to them to grab bribes in the low-income ones. This shameless sort of people demanded anything – whisky, brandy, yams, cocks and even eggs – from people for their selfish ends.
    The public life of Nigeria was damn corrupt. Ten percent had become a popular “epithet” for bribes. Is it not true that some honourable members’ speeches were sometimes drowned with shouts of “wuru wuru” and such like in Parliament? And were some Ministers not really corrupt? We can recall a publication in the defunct Daily Service of May 16, 1959, stating that “a corrupt Minister is a greater danger to the country than anyone or anything can be. He can sell the nation while pretending to protect her interests…And no true Nigerian would like to see an independent Nigeria tossed about by FILTHY LUCRE… We are developing a false sense of values in this country. There is the feeling abroad that politics is a money making business…”
    Weaknesses
    Sometime in 1965, a Member of Parliament asked the then Prime Minister as to when he intended “to introduce the projected legislation to deal with corruption as promised in two previous addresses by His Excellency to Parliament”. In answer, the Prime Minister said: “The proposal was abandoned because all the Governments in the Federation were not unanimous in introducing uniform legislation to deal with corruption. It was found that the main object of the projected legislation would be completely frustrated by persons involved transferring accounts to banks operating elsewhere in the Republic.” This was published in the House of Representatives Official Report of Parliamentary Debates (Second Parliament! Volume 18, No. 17, of Thursday, 22nd April, 1965.
    The difficulties of the Prime Minister were quite understandable; but were those not ‘some of the weaknesses of his Government which had led to a chain of events until we now find ourselves in the throes of a civil war?
    Let us now take stock of ourselves. What have we really gained, as individuals or as a nation, from all the hustle and bustle of dirty politics and the wealth corruptly acquired since our Independence? Is it not true that some had died before their time, others in jail and some others are now languishing in misery and dejection?
    God’s word is always true. Some men may brush it aside or attempt to suppress it, but it will yet have its way and come true. King Solomon, under the inspiration of God, stated that righteousness exalts a nation, and added. “But SIN is a reproach to any people”. (Proverbs 14: 34) Have we not seen enough of this reproach in our country?
    Today, Nigeria is groaning because of the heinous sins of some of her people which include bribery and corruption. The Government had been robbed of many good things through the corruption of certain people who were placed in privileged positions. There is doubt whether certain individuals were not even richer than the Government. Now, it is everybody including the innocent and oppressed poor that is bearing the brunt of their iniquities. It was Jeremiah the prophet who lamented: “Our fathers have sinned, and are not; and we have borne their iniquities.” (Lamentation 5: 7) May God Almighty come to the rescue of the poor and oppressed and spare Nigeria for His mercy’s sake. Amen.
    Wealth acquired through corruption or any other evil means is a curse, and decent people who are godly-minded have no respect for those who thrive on bribery and corruption. Unless they repent they shall die suddenly and leave them to others. Thus said the Lord: “As the partridge sitteth on egg s, and hatcheth them not; so he that getteth riches, and not by right, shall leave them in the midst of his days, and at his end shall be a fool.” “Though he heap up silver as the dust and prepare raiment as the clay;… the just shall put it on, and the innocent shall divide the silver…”- Jeremiah 17: 11; Job 27: 13-23.
    Retribution
    The Chief Justice of the Federal Supreme Court of Nigeria, Sir Adetokunbo Ademola, was once interviewed by a representative of the African Challenge and was quoted as saying that “fraud, bribery, and corruption are sin”. He went on, “The offender may enjoy wealth acquired through wickedness and escape punishment while alive, but his children and his grandchildren after him very often suffer poverty and wretchedness because of his dishonest life. ” (Vide the African Challenge of March 1962).
    It is true that children do suffer the retribution of their father’s wickedness, more so from God when they (the children) themselves behave like their father. But God provides in His law that if the children fear Him and do righteousness the iniquities of their father will not be visited upon them. – Numbers 14: 18; Exodus 20: 5, 6; Deuteronomy 24: 16; Psalm 106: 3; Acts 10:34,35.
    We will add that if the dishonest man perchance escapes man’s punishment, he can never escape that of God. This is more the reason why men should fear God and “abstain from all appearance of evil”. (1 Thessalonians 5: 22) And St. Paul stated: “For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.” – 2 Corinthians 5: 10.
    How can the disease of bribery and corruption be cured? Please, read what the Chief Justice says backed with the soul- saving word of God in the next issue of “The Weekly Sermon”.
    
    May the good Lord help His sheep to do His will always so that they may be truly rich and saved. Amen.`, 
    title:"THE LOVE OF MONEY (1)"},
 {key:19, 
    content:`“THAT which is ill got, though it may increase much, will not last long. A man may perhaps, raise a great estate in a little time, by usury and extortion, fraud and oppression of the poor, but it will not continue; he gathers it for himself, but it shall prove to have been gathered for somebody else that he has no kindness for,” says Henry.

    We have always made it quite clear that it is not a sin for one to be rich. Solomon, who himself was the richest king in his days, said: “The blessing of the Lord, it maketh rich, and He addeth no sorrow with it.” (Proverbs 10: 22) But the trouble with many people in our time is that they amass wealth through fraud, bribery and corruption, oppression of the poor and other evil means.
    
    The God’s Kingdom Society (GKS) had long foreseen that Nigeria would, sooner or later, be plunged into chaos because of the excesses of certain politicians and some godless people who though t that money was all that mat t ere d in life. They therefore stopped at nothing in making themselves, by hook or by crook, to be rich. Thus many others in the public services and in private lives developed an unrestricted bent towards material acquisition, and the Nigerian society became infested with bribery and corruption and their attendant evils. Indeed, the Bible says: “He that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye, and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him.” – Proverbs 28: 22.
    
    GKS Vindicated
    
    Our warnings against the godless and materialistic tendencies and ideologies of the politicians and their followers, before and after Nigerian Independence, were not heeded; rather we were called names. Yes, “the poor man’s wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard”. (Ecclesiastes 9: 16) But how is it today? has the GKS not been vindicated?
    
     
    
    We can recall that as far back as 1958, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe admitted at the banned NCNC Executive Committee meeting held at the Lagos City College, that they had followed the “SELFISH DESIRES OF OUR OWN HEARTS”. This happened when there was an internal wrangle in the party. He asked his colleagues in that meeting to close their eyes while he read this prayer:
    “Our Father in heaven, we pray that You save us from ourselves. The world that You made for us, to live in peace we have made into an armed camp. We live in fear of war to come…We have turned from You to go our selfish way. We have broken Your commandments and denied Your truth. We have left your altars to serve the false gods of money and pleasure and power. Forgive us and help us. Now, darkness gathers around us and we are confused in all our counsels…” (Vide the Daily Times of June 16, 1958, page l6 – italics ours)
    
    Let the lovers of money read over again and ponder the above prayer.
    
    It is a pity that some of the very ills, which include bribery and corruption, that led to the fall of the First Republic are still rearing their ugly heads in Nigeria up till today. Many people are hypocrites. For while they pay lip-services to the cause of Nigerian unity, they perpetrate the evils that can ruin the nation, and make difficult for the honest ones the task of keeping Nigeria united.
    
    New Order
    
    When the Military Government came into power, it promised among other things that “in the new order of things, there should be no place for subjugation of personal service to personal aggrandisement, nepotism and corruption”. This was made known by the former Head of the Military Government, the late Major-General Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi, at a meeting in State House, Lagos, in February 1966. (Daily Times, February 22, 1966)
    
    In a “Statement of Policy” broadcast to the nation in August 1966, the present Head of the Military Government, Major- General Yakubu Gowon, stated: “One point which I had not hitherto made abundantly clear is that my Government is very determined to stamp out corrupt practices and to bring to book all persons, including those recently released from detention, against whom there is evidence of improper practice and criminal acts.” (Morning Post, August 10, 1966).
    
    Following this assurance of the Military Government, certain measures have been taken by way of inquiries both at Federal level and in some of the States. The findings made known so far are shocking and reveal how corrupt some people, being looked upon as “gentlemen” and godly, are. We congratulate the Federal and State Military Governments on their bold steps in exposing evils and depriving crooks of their ill-gotten gains.
    
    Some people do not fear God, neither do they learn from past mistakes or the experience of others. Today, bribery and corruption are again in full swing. The sins of those engaged in it shall find them out in God’s time. – Numbers 32: 23.
    Addressing a meeting of some officials of Local Government Councils in the Mid- Western State, the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Benin City, was reported as saying, “Revenue collectors who should collect taxes to swell the coffers of the council in fact swell their own coffers by taking bribes of 5/- to 10/- from tax defaulters who find this cheaper than paying the normal expected tax of £3: 10/-. As a result the officials get richer and make capital investments all over the place out of proportion to their income level while the council gets poorer and cannot even maintain the rudimentary roads in its area.” (Vide the Mid-Western Nigeria PRESS RELEASE of Thursday August 22, 1968).
    
    Bribe-mongers have formed their own terms and phrases for the purpose of begging for tips or demanding bribes. The saying, “nothing goes for nothing”, is common among them. The words, “kola” and “dash” are their popular synonyms for the word, bribe. You enter an office to ask for something to which you are entitled but the officer in charge, if he is of the corrupt type, will then tell you: “If you know how to ‘walk’, or if you ‘walk’ well, you will get it.” Is it not surprising that a fully grown-up man must have to learn again how to walk in some offices? If you are not the sort of those who are used to such dastardly language or the “kola game”, the officer and his colleagues may even laugh at your “ignorance” for not knowing what people are doing or for not “behaving as a gentleman “.
    
    It is our humble appeal that the Authorities should do everything humanly possible to get rid of this kind of evil men or vicious “beggars” in the public services of the country.
    
    According to the Law Book of God, the Bible, it is not only those whose corrupt practices have come to the open that are guilty of sin, but also those whose offences are hidden. Except those still covered repent thoroughly to the pleasure of God, their “secret sins” shall be revealed in due time and great will be their shame. (Psalm 90: 8; Hebrews 4: 13) St. Paul said: “Some men’s sins are open before hand, going before to judgment; and some men they follow after. Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand; and they that lire otherwise cannot be hid.”- 1 Timothy 5: 24, 25.
    
    Another factor that is hardening the hearts of some people in their corrupt dealings is their hope in the secret societies to which they belong. It must be pointed out to such ones that their days are awaiting them. For when their cups of iniquity shall have been filled, God shall deal with them and reward them with the fruit of their doings. No secret society or human effort then can help them.
    
    We believe that there are good people in secret societies. We appeal to such ones not to help the bad characters who, among them, involve themselves in criminal acts. If they do, they will be partakers of their iniquities or crimes; and though they may avert man’s punishment or that of the Government, they CANNOT AVERT OR ESCAPE GOD’S OWN. HE WILL CERTAINLY PUNISH THEM. – Proverbs 11: 21; Isaiah 3: 11; 1 Peter 3: 10-12; Ecclesiastes I2: 13 14.
    
    The Role of the Church
    
    In a situation such as we find in this country, the role of the Church is of paramount importance. Religious leaders must always come out in a straightforward condemnation of evils such as fraud, bribery and corruption, and so forth. Their spiritual responsibilities are very great. This can better be appreciated from the following charge of God to His servant: “So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my month, and warn them from me. When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand. Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.”- Ezekiel 33: 7-9.
    
    All those who have been found to be corrupt and others not yet revealed are mostly members of one religious group or another. But what have their leaders done to check their excesses in violation of God’s commandments? It is in this respect many church leaders in Nigeria have been charged with duplicity and as having failed in their spiritual duties.
    
    After the tragic events or January 15, 1966, which resulted in a change of Government, the Baptist Church of Nigeria did a praiseworthy thing in promptly coming out with an open admission of their fault for lying dormant while some of their members who were politicians committed sinful acts in careless freedom. A document captioned, “MEMO OF THE NATIONAL SITUA TION” dated February 1st, 1966, and signed by a leader of the Baptist Church, speaks for itself and states in part:
    
    “During the five years when the British no longer determined our policies we have witnessed the effects of sin in various aspects of our national life. We have learnt to accommodate ourselves to acts of selfishness, greed, lusts, pride, corruption, tribalism, deceit. Less and less the freedom we had hoped were inherent in the lives of an independent nation became illusive…
    
    “We Baptists once derived joy as champions of freedom and justice, of truth and honesty. However, our heads are bowed in shame as people observed that the distressing atrocities were committed in the area where our denomination had the strongest influence, where many Baptists were in key positions in Government and quasi-Government bodies. Many of us in the Ministry and in teaching, as well as in other walks of life, become ardent supporters of evil policies and practices in total disregard of Jesus Christ and his demands. We flattered corrupt politicians for personal private profit. We sang their praises in the Assembly of God’s people. We connived at sin. Worst still, when some try to proclaim what they understand the will of God to be-two or three instances of such actually came to our hearing- some frightened Christians warned them to be careful! We are living in fear! Need I extend the catalogue further to indicate how all of us were implicated in the moral confusion of the times? May God forgive us!”
    
    The Baptist Church is not alone in this sort of unchristian attitude in tacitly permitting evil. There are several other religious bodies that are equally guilty, and they know themselves. However, the frankness and sincerity of the Baptist Church in owning its fault is appreciated. May God forgive them as they have prayed. But the GKS – this is no self -praise-on several occasions warned the nation against sin; her Press Release in the Daily Times of September 30, 1960 on the eve of Independence captioned, “Only By Righteousness will Independent Nigeria Survive”, is an instance.
    
    Before the Military take-over in January 1966, the GKS, through her President also warned against the danger ahead if things continued as they were at that time. Copies of the warning letter were sent to the late Prime Minister, the then Regional Governors and Premiers, Dr. Orizu, Acting President of the Federal Government, religious leaders and leading politicians in the country. But the warning was not heeded. Today, it is all of us – the guilty and the stubborn ones as well as the innocent – that are suffering! May God have mercy on us.
    
    Although the Military Government has promised to stamp out corruption, we will be expecting too much to think that it can go beyond the limit of human strength. But it can do and achieve much with the support and co-operation of godly, honest people. The power to wipe out evil from the entire surface of the earth, rests with God alone. And very soon in this our Age, He, through Jesus Christ, will take action towards this end, and ALL INIQUITY will come to an end.
    
    The Remedy
    
    Chief Justice Ademola was reported as saying “that bribery, though a dangerous disease, is curable”, And he added, “It can be cured only through a deep spiritual awakening, through the Ministry of the Christian Church,” (African Challenge of March 1962, emphasis ours)
    
    We agree with the Chief Justice, Anyone who claims to be a Christian and still indulges in bribery is not yet converted. St. Paul admonished that we should be transformed by the renewing of our minds so that we might prove “what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God”. (Romans 12: 1,2) And he further said: “Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things (including fraud, bribery and corruption) are passed away; behold, all things are become new.” – 2 Corinthians 5: 17.
    
    We have said enough to expose the vanity of false riches and the dangers of bribery and corruption. If those still engaging in them do not repent, all they acquire through bribery and corruption shall be destroyed by God. As it is written: “For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery, They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit.” – Job 15: 34, 35.
    
    Our humble advice is that those who have been giving or receiving bribes should repent of their sins so that God may forgive them. There is no sense in continuing to do that which always pricks your conscience, incurs the anger of men, lowers your prestige, and will eventually bring you the condemnation of God. It was the Psalmist who prayed: “Judge me, O LORD; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in the LORD; therefore I shall not slide. Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men: in whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes,” – Psalm 26: 1, 9-10.
    
    In Isaiah 55: 7, there is the warning that the wicked should forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his evil thoughts; that he should return to God and He will have mercy upon him. And Jesus Christ directed an assuring call to all mankind when he said: “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.” – Matthew 11: 28-30.
    
    No matter how many and serious your past sins may be, take an advantage of this opportunity you have of hearing or reading this sermon, and REPENT and retrace your steps to Jesus so that his salvation and other blessings may be your lot.
    
    It pays to fear God, and to lead a godly and sober life. We cannot end this sermon without reminding you of the following admonition of St. Paul: “But godliness with contentment is great gain. For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out. And having food and raiment let us be therewith content. But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition. For the love of money is the root of all evil which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.” – I Timothy 6: 6-10.
    
    And to every true Christian the apostle added this exhortation: “But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness. Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, where- unto thou art also called and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.” – 1 Timothy 6: 11, 12.
    
    The remedy for the disease of bribery and corruption lies, therefore, in the fear of God by which “men depart from evil”. (Proverbs 16: 6) Christ’s warning is that men should “beware of covetousness”. – Luke 12: 15- 21; see also Hebrews 13: 5, 6.
    
    O God, help us Thy sheep to keep Thy commandments always as eloquent evidence of our love for Thee and Thy Son our Redeemer so that we may be saved. Amen.`,

    content:`AMONG the promises of God Almighty, that of the resurrection of the dead is one of the most outstanding showing the greatness of His power and His good purpose towards mankind.  It is the pivot upon which rests the hope of Christians concerning the dead, and if not for this hope man cannot count himself as anything better than a beast.
    Resurrection means a rising from the dead, or the act of bringing back to life. It is one of the fundamental doctrines of the Christian faith in the Holy Bible.
    When Adam sinned the sentence of death was passed upon him by God. Consequently, his offspring having been born in sin were declared guilty and thus death, which is the penalty of sin, was brought upon the entire human race. – Genesis 3: 17-19; Romans 5: 12-19; 6: 23.
    To think that this world will continue in sin under the wicked overlordship of the devil forever is ignorance of the divine purpose. God had promised to set up a new order of things both in heaven and earth – the New World now in the making – in which there shall be nothing evil. Concerning this grand arrangement of God, St. Peter declared: “Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.”- 2 Peter 3: 13.
    The Lord’s Promise
    In order that His faithful worshippers who have died may have the golden opportunity of enjoying the bliss of that New World – THE WORLD WITHOUT END – as a reward of their loyalty and services, God promised not only to redeem man from the power of the grave by the resurrection of the dead but also to bring death to an end. He declared: “I will ransom them from the power of the grave: I will redeem them from death: O death, 1 will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction: repentance shall be hid from mine eyes.”- Hosea 13: 14.
    The ancient faithful before Christ built their hope upon the Lord’s promise. They knew that death was just a temporal state which could not bar them from coming back to receive their reward from God at His appointed time.
    Job, a prophet of God, who underwent fiery temptations at the instance of the devil, spoke of the grave as a hiding place and hoped earnestly for the time when God would bring about his change at the resurrection. He said: “O that Thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that Thou wouldest keep me secret, until Thy wrath be past, that Thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!” (Job 14: 13) He asked, “If a man die, shall he live again?” Yes, of course. He then went on, “All the days of my appointed time will I wait, (in the grave) till my change come. Thou (God) shalt can, and I win answer Thee: Thou wilt have desire to the work of Thine hands.” (Verses 14 and 15).
    Job did not stop at this, for the Spirit of God further moved him into a more positive, prophetic declaration of his belief, thus: “For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: and though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God…” – Job 19: 25-27.
    There is also the instance of the prophecy of Isaiah concerning the resurrection of the dead. He said: “Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.” –  Isaiah 26: 19.
    That children are also among those to be raised from the dead is a fact having concrete support of the Scriptures. When Herod, the wicked king, massacred innocent children in Bethlehem in his attempt to kill the infant, Jesus, God comforted the bereaved with the assurance that their children would come to life again from the grave termed “the land of the enemy” in fulfillment of His prophecy recorded in Jeremiah 31: 15-17. See also Matt. 2: 13-18.
    When Jesus Christ came to this earth he confirmed in his teachings that resurrection is a reality. There was an occasion when he crossed swords with the Sadducees on the question of resurrection and defeated them. The Sadducees did not believe in resurrection, and so they asked him: “Master, Moses said, ‘If a man should die childless, his brother shall marry the widow and carry on his brother’s family.’ Now we knew of seven brothers. The first married and died, and as he was without issue his wife was left to his brother. The same thing happen with the second, and the third, and so on with all seven. Last of all the woman died. At the resurrection, then, whose wife will she be, for they had all married her? – Matthew 22: 23-28; New English Bible.
    In his answer, Jesus told them point- blank: “You are mistaken, because you know neither the scriptures nor the power of God. At the resurrection men and women do not marry, but are like angels in heaven.” – Matthew 22: 29, 30, N. E. B.
    Keys of Hell
    Jesus Christ even made it known that he is the one whom the Heavenly Father had vested with the power to raise the dead. He said: “For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will. Verily, verily, I say unto you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.” (John 5: 21, 25-27) That was why he told Martha: “I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.” -John 11: 25.
    He showed an example of the power when Lazarus who had died and had already been four days in the tomb, was raised to life by him. – John 11: 32-45.
    The devil caused Jesus Christ to be killed by wicked men with the intent, no doubt, to defeat the all-important purpose of God. But the Most High, in exercise of His infinite power, raised him from the dead the third day and crowned him with power, glory and honour. Jesus himself declared: “I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.” (Revelation 1: 18) The “keys” in this context are symbolic of the power or authority to release the dead from “hell”, that is, the grave; and put an end to death.
    The resurrection of Jesus Christ was a clear demonstration of the certainty of God’s promise as regards the rising again of the dead, and has strongly enlivened the hope of all Christians. – 1 Peter 1: 3.
    In defence of the Christian faith, the early apostles preached the resurrection from the dead. (Acts 4: 1-4; 17: 18) Because of St. Paul’s belief and teaching about it, he suffered persecutions and prosecutions at the hands of the unbelieving Jews. When he was indicted before King Agrippa he declared: “And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers; unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hope’s sake, King Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.” He then asked, “Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?” – Acts 26: 6-8.
    Indisputable Fact
    St. Paul, in his first epistle to the Corinthians, stated that if there was no resurrection then all the preaching and sufferings of Christians were vain.
    He added: “For if the dead rise not then is not Christ raised. If Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sin… If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.” He proved clearly that resurrection is an indisputable fact. – 1 Corinthians 15: 12-33.
    For anyone, therefore, to have doubt about the possibility of resurrection is an evidence of lack of faith. It was from the dust of the ground God made man, and if man turns to dust again there is no reason why it should be considered an impossibility for God to bring him back to life.
    But some may ask, “How are the dead raised? and what kind of body will they have?” To such questions St. Paul gave an illustrative answer to the effect that the seed you sow in the ground does not grow into a plant unless it “dies” first. And when the green shoot comes up out of the seed, it is very different from the seed you first planted. For what you sow is just a dry little seed, perhaps of wheat, of some other kind. “But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased Him, and to every seed his own body…So also is the resurrection of the dead”, said St. Paul. “It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.” – 1 Corinthians 15: 35-43.
    One salient point which some people seldom consider is that it is not only the righteous that will be resurrected but the wicked as well. And everyone will be rewarded by God according to his works – good or bad. It is an understanding of these Scriptural facts that have always made the true worshippers of God to be zealous and steadfast in their faith not- withstanding the threats of death by the wicked. They know that even if they are killed because of their conviction God will raise them from the dead to glory in due course. So, too, a wicked man who escapes punishment in this life will come again to face the consequences of his actions.
    
    While some at the resurrection, will be rewarded abundantly with everlasting blessings, others will be punished and covered with shame. Concerning this Daniel, under the inspiration of the Al- mighty God, prophesied: “And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.” – Daniel 12: 2.
    First Resurrection
    The order and classification of resurrection are shown in the Scriptures. St. Paul stated: “But every man in his own order: Christ the first fruits; after- ward they that are Christ’s at his’ coming.” (1 Corinthians 15: 23).
    There is the first resurrection which is that of Jesus Christ and the Saints who are the Anointed Christians numbering 144,000. Among the disciples of Jesus the anointed ones are the first class. They constitute the “Little Flock” of which the twelve apostles were foundation members. (Luke 12: 32; James 1: 18) They die in the flesh but they are raised as spirits like Jesus to dwell in heaven – the New Heaven – and reign with Christ in his glorious Kingdom. – 1 Peter 3: 18; 2 Corinthians 5: 1-4.
    When St. Paul stated, “It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body” (1 Cor. 15: 44) he was referring to the death and resurrection of those of the “Little Flock” of which he is one. And he added: “And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly. Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.”- 1 Corinthians 15: 49, 50.
    The Scriptures show vividly that it .is at the second presence of Jesus Christ in the last days that the first resurrection would take place. (John 14: 1-3; 1 Corinthians 15: 44-57; 2 Timothy 4: 6-8; Philippians 3: 20; 1 Thessalonians 4: 16; Revelation 20: 4-6; etc.) This is already fulfilling but being events of a spiritual nature many people including religious leaders and theologians do not know.
    Better Resurrection
    The faithful men and women of old before Christ will have their part in what St. Paul described as a “better resurrection”. (Hebrews 11: 4-40) They will all be raised from the dead to dwell on this earth, not in heaven, to receive their reward. Concerning them, St. Paul wrote: “Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens. Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured. not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection.” – Hebrews 11: 33-35.
    What a wonderful, glorious and happy occasion it will be when those great just men and women will come back from “the land of the enemy” and team up with the faithful Christians on earth! But with the enemies of truth and righteousness, shame, wailing and torment will be their portion. Jesus Christ, knowing this, spoke of how there would be weeping and gnashing of teeth when those who falsely claim God’s Kingdom would be driven out of it while the true Christians from all corners of the earth would be in it with Abraham and other ancient worthies who shall have then been resurrected. – Matthew 8: 11, 12; Luke 13: 28,29.
    General Resurrection
    Finally, there will be a general resurrection during which all the remaining good people as well as bad ones will find their feet on earth again. The good will be rewarded with everlasting life in perfect peace and happiness in paradise on earth while the bad ones will be judged and punished according to their sins, Concerning this Jesus said: “Wonder not at this; for the hour cometh, wherein all that are in the graves shall bear the voice of the Son of God. And they that have done good things shall come forth unto the resurrection of life; but they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment.” – John 5: 28,29. (Douay Version)
    What is more, St. Paul confessed his faith about resurrection before Felix and said among other things: “But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they can heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets: And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.”- Acts 24: 14, 15.
    Great Comfort
    It is because of this glorious hope of the resurrection of the dead, which is a great comfort to those having its understanding, true Christians do not mourn for the dead like the pagans who have no hope. To this end Paul the apostle, gave this exhortation: “But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. Wherefore comfort one another with these words.” – 1 Thessalonians 4: 13, 14, 18.

    content:`OF all the divers laws and ordinances enacted by God through Moses the prophet, the Sabbath Law was one of those the breaking of which carried capital punishment. But the advent of Jesus Christ brought a modification of the law and, subsequently, the understanding that the Sabbath was among those things which were a shadow of things to come.
    The sabbath day was the seventh day of the week on which the children of Israel were by law enjoined to refrain from all kinds of work. This was one of the Ten Commandments. God said: “Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.” – Exodus 20: 8-11.
    
     
    
    Stringent Law
    
    It was a requirement of the law that no fire should be kindled on the sabbath day. The law was stringent, and the penalty for breaking it was death. In Exodus 35: 2-3, it is written: “Six days shall work be done but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD: whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to death. Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day.”
    
     
    
    There was an occasion when the children of Israel were in the wilderness that a certain man who was gathering sticks on the sabbath day was caught. The man was brought before Moses and Aaron, and all the congregation of the people. He was found guilty, and God’s sentence was this: “The man shall be surely put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.” Indeed this sentence of the Lord was at once executed. – Numbers 15: 32-36.
    
     
    
    After the return of the Jews from Babylonish captivity, the faithful observed the sabbath law with all seriousness. Trading on the sabbath day was prohibited. (Nehemiah 10: 31) It happened at one time that when Nehemiah the prophet took notice that some of the Jews violated the sabbath by making purchases on that day, he strongly objected. And because of the misconduct of the people in this regard, he ordered that the gates of Jerusalem should be shut and should not be opened until the sabbath was over.
    
    Here is his own record:
    
    “In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals. There dwelt men of Tyre also therein which brought fish, and all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem. Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, what evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day? And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I at the gates that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.” – Nehemiah 13:15-17.
    
     
    
    Modification
    
    Long before Jesus Christ was born on the earth, the prophet Moses, moved by the Spirit of God, had told the nation of Israel in a prophecy concerning him (Christ) thus: “The LORD thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from among the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken.” – Deuteronomy 18: 15.
    
     
    
    As a matter of fact, the advent of Jesus Christ brought about a change from the old to the new covenant. It was because the unbelieving Jews in his days ignored the prophetic instruction about the expected Messiah – the Greater Prophet – that they failed to recognise or acknowledge the pre-eminent position of Jesus Christ. In John 1: 17, it is written: “For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.”
    
     
    
    By virtue of the authority God gave to Jesus Christ, he modified the Sabbath Law. There was never a time he taught his disciples to keep the sabbath. Rather, he showed – by precept and example – that for doing any good work on the sabbath day no one deserved to be punished.
    
     
    
    One of the things that often brought conflict between Jesus Christ and the fanatical Jews was the question of the Sabbath. He did good works on the Sabbath day and even allowed his disciples “to pluck ears of corn, and to eat”, which according to the Pharisees was “not lawful to do upon the Sabbath day” – Matthew 12:1-8; Mark 2:23-28.
    
     
    
    In the synagogue of the Jews into which he went there was a man with a withered hand. And when the Pharisees asked whether it was lawful to heal a man on the sabbath day in order to find fault with him, he answered: “What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out? How much more then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days.” – Matthew 12: 9-12. See also Mark 3: 1-5.
    
     
    
    There was another occasion when Jesus Christ, on the sabbath day, cured an impotent man at the pool of Bethesda. Instead of the Jews to glorify God and rejoice with the man who was cured, they harassed him saying, “It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.” But the poor fellow replied, “He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.” (John 5: 1-11) And when the hardhearted Jews knew that it was Jesus who cured the man, they persecuted him “and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day”. (verses 15, 16) Notwithstanding, Jesus defended himself and justified his action by saying, “My Father has never yet ceased His work, and I am working too.” – verse 17, New English Bible.
    
    Moreover, none of the apostles of Jesus Christ ever enjoined the Christian believers to observe the sabbath. When the council of the Apostles and elders in Jerusalem sent word to the Gentile converts at Antioch, Syria and Cilicia as to what they should do, they did not ask them to keep the sabbath. – Acts 15: 22-31.
    
     
    
    Shadow
    
    That the sabbath law was among those Ordinances blotted out by Jesus Christ, as stated by St Paul, is beyond argument. For this reason the apostle admonished: “Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of a holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days: which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.” – Colossians 2: 14-17.
    
     
    
    The bottom has been knocked off the argument of those who hold that Christians should keep the sabbath. It is wrong to stick to the demands of the Mosaic law instead of the truth and faith of Jesus Christ. St. Paul showed clearly that the law served as a kind of tutor to lead the Jews to Christ and that since he (Christ) had come “we are no longer under a schoolmaster”. (Galatians 3: 23-25) He also said: “Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ…” – Galatians 2: 16.
    
    Among the churches that claim to be keeping the Sabbath, there is disagreement as to whether Saturday or Sunday is the sabbath day. There should be no dispute over this if men would be true to themselves. The seventh day of the week, according to the Bible (Exodus 20: 10,11), which is Saturday, is the sabbath day. In his Encyclopedia of Religion and Religions, E. Royston Pike, an ecclesiastical scholar, stated: “Among Jews the sabbath is reckoned from Friday sunset to Saturday sunset.” (Page 332).
    
     
    
    Sunday Observance
    
    The change of the sabbath from Saturday to Sunday was made by Constantine, a Roman emperor. He made a law in 321 A.D. for the observance of Sunday throughout the Roman Empire. About this, Frank Loris Peterson wrote: “Seeking to please both the Christians. Who observed the seventh-day Sabbath, and the pagans, who worshipped the sun on the first day of the week, he (Constantine) ‘artfully balanced the hopes and fears of his subjects by publishing in the same year two edicts, the first of which enjoined the solemn observance of Sunday, and the second directed the regular consultation of the Aruspices (a pagan practice).'” (The Hope of the Race, pages 110-111). His quotation was from the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire by Edward Gibbon.
    
     
    
    Concerning the Sunday observance, The American Peoples Encyclopedia states: “Historically, Sunday came to be identified with the Sabbath, specifically in regard to its observance. The Emperor Constantine’s decree A.D. 321, making Sunday a day of rest from general labor, but providing for exceptions, such as keeping open the market place, is an example of civil laws regulating the day’s observance after Christianity had become a legal religion.” (Vol. 16, page 845).
    
     
    
    The teaching that Christians, as the Explanatory Catechism says, are “commanded to keep the Sunday holy” is a distortion of Bible truth. Many of the wrongs in Christendom sprang from the imposition of Roman paganism upon Christian practices.
    
     
    
    People know that those claiming to be keeping the sabbath – Saturday or Sunday – are deceiving themselves. If we are to go by the terms of the sabbath law, we do not think that any of the so-called sabbath – keepers would be living since the penalty for breaking it was death. Do some not go to the offices to work on Sundays or Saturdays? Do they not kindle fire, make purchases or do some other works? If they don’t, granted, what about their children, servants, or domestic animals? The law says, “Thou shalt not do ANY work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates.” – Exodus 20: 10.
    
     
    
    However, the vital point we must emphasise, is that Christians are not bound to keep the sabbath-be it Saturday or Sunday. One is free to rest oneself any day. The law of faith and grace under Christ does not tie anyone to a particular day to rest. The sabbath is not to control us; and Jesus Christ told the Pharisees: “The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath: therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.” – Mark 2: 27-28.
    
     
    
    Real Rest
    
    The word sabbath means rest. The time for the real rest or sabbath that God promised His true worshippers, of which the Mosaic sabbath was a type, has not come. That will be in God’s Kingdom fully established, and it is towards that rest we as Christians are labouring. Concerning that antitypical rest, St. Paul wrote: “For if Jesus (that is, Joshua) had given them (the Jews) rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day. There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God…Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, least any man fall after the same example of unbelief.” – Hebrews 4: 8-11.
    
    Jesus Christ, the Leader and Master of Christians, worked on the sabbath day. If therefore his disciples work on the sabbath day, they do not break God’s law since Jesus Christ whom Moses told the Jews to look to and obey, has amended the law. “The sabbath”, said he, “was made for man and not man for the sabbath.” This is the truth and it is clear.`,

    content:`THE only hope of suffering humanity the perfect Kingdom of God. All through the chequered history of world empire, never had there existed any system of government that satisfied the needs of mankind. But because God’s Kingdom has the answer to all human problems and woes it is rightly designated in the Scriptures as “the desire of all nation”.

 

    Not many people have an accurate knowledge of what the Kingdom of God is. To some who professed to be Christians, it means going to heaven to enjoin eternal bliss; others regard it as a good living or a life of pleasure in this world; and yet some others say that God’s Kingdom is in one’s “belly” when one does not allow evil to rule one’s heart.
    
     
    
    The word kingdom is intelligibly defined in The Conscise Oxford Dictionary as a “territory subject to king”. Thus God’s Kingdom is the universal empire or government of righteousness and peace covering both heaven and earth to be inhabited by spirit persons and human beings, under the control of Jehovah, the Almighty God, “Who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings and Lord of lords” (1 Timothy 6:15). This is the form of government known as Theocracy. It does not make sense, therefore, to think of God’s Kingdom as a state of condition or as something which the human belly can accommodate!
    
     
    
    God has long promised through His prophets to establish His Kingdom wherein His faithful worshippers of all ages will be blessed with eternal life in perfect peace and happiness. The history of the world is dotted with the rise and fall of government but God‟ Kingdom is one that knows no decline or decay – it is an everlasting perfect government. In glory and majesty, and all that answers to righteousness, it excels all others.
    
     
    
    King David, in one of his famous songs, declared: “All thy works shall praise thee, O LORD; and thy saints shall bless thee. They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power; To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom. Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations.” – Psalm 145:10-13.
    
     
    
    The importance of God’s Kingdom cannot be over-emphasised. It was the message of hope and salvation that Jesus Christ brought to this world. At the very beginning of his ministry on earth, he proclaimed: “Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” (Matthew 4:17) Later on, he taught his disciples to pray to our Heavenly Father:
    
    “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth,
    
    as it is in heaven.” – Matthew 6:9,10.
    
    Jesus Christ further showed the paramount importance of the Kingdom when said: “But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things (that is, our needs) shall be added unto you.” Matthew 6:33.
    
     
    
    What is more, Christ particularly instructed that the good tidings of God’s Government, which, he very well knew, would bring comfort to the poor and relief to the broken-hearted, should be proclaimed throughout the world. Said he: “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.” – Matthew 24:14
    
     
    
    Head and King
    
    The Holy Bible clearly shows that God Almighty has appointed and crowned Jesus Christ as the head and king of His glorious Government. Concerning him, Isaiah prophesied: “For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end…”(Isaiah 9:6,7) He further said: “Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.” – Isaiah 32:1.
    
     
    
    The coronation of Jesus Christ, ever before it took place in heaven, was long, long ago revealed to Daniel the prophet in a vision. He stated: “And there was given him (Christ) dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.” – Daniel 7:13,14.
    
     
    
    Jesus Christ himself testified to his kingship before Pontius Pilate during his mission on earth. He said: “My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.” And when Pilate asked him, whether he was a king, he answered positively: “Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth…” – John 18:36,37.
    
     
    
    Referring to Jesus Christ who should rule righteously in God’s Kingdom St Paul said, quoting the Psalms, “Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.” Hebrews 1:9; Psalm 45:7.
    
     
    
    The Capital
    
    The capital of God’s Kingdom is Mount Zion in heaven. It is the seat of Christ the King about whom God said: “Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.” (Psalm 2:6) With Jesus Christ in heaven, apart from the holy angels, are those who constitute his cabinet. These are the anointed Christians, the saints, numbering 144,000 chosen from among men on earth beginning from the twelve apostles. They make up the “Little Flock” as distinct from other countless disciples who are the “Other Sheep”. (Luke 12:32; John 10:16)
    
     
    
    The revelation of Jesus Christ to his apostle in a vision concerning himself and his cabinet gives no room for doubt. St John wrote: “And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb (that is, Christ – John 1:29) stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father’s name written in their foreheads…These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins (that is, in the sense of spiritual purity). These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb. And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God.” – Revelation 14:1-5.
    
     
    
    It is an indisputable fact of the Scriptures that the saints (not canonized, man-made saints) are made kings and priest under Christ to reign with him in his Kingdom. (Luke 22:28-30; Revelation 1:6; 5:10). This honour is given them by a special grace of God. Everyone of them, by reason of his calling and the anointing of the Holy Spirit, is a leader or shepherd who must devote his life wholly and solely to the service of Christ in preaching the gospel of the kingdom, as the early apostles did, in order to win souls to him. – Matthew 4:18-22; Mark 16:15-20.
    
     
    
    Kingdom on Earth
    
    We must at this junction state with all emphasis that it is not the 144,000 anointed Christians alone that will be saved as some erroneously think. There are countless numbers of others – men and women – who would be saved. But the point is that their place in God’s Kingdom is not heaven but the earth made glorious – a paradise wherein abounds perpetual happiness for the saved ones. – Psalm 37:10-11,22; 2 Peter 3:13.
    
     
    
    If only people understand the Lord’s Prayer, there would be no scramble by almost everyone for heaven. Christ taught his disciples to pray for the kingdom to come so that God’s will might be done on earth as in heaven. If these people have the understanding of, and faith in this prayer why do they want to go to heaven and not wish to be in the kingdom on earth? And if all the good will go to heaven as some preachers are teaching, who be on the earth to do the Lord’s will when the kingdom comes?
    
     
    
    However, the question as to when the Kingdom would come or whether it has come or not, will be treated in due course.
    
     
    
    Jesus Christ did not say that all the righteous would be in heaven. Rather he said, “Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.” – Matthew 5:5; see also Proverbs 2:21,22.
    
     
    
    It is great a privilege and blessing for one to be favoured to be in God’s Kingdom on earth, which is described as “the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down (to EARTH) from God out of heaven.” – Revelation 21:1,2.
    
     
    
    All the holy men and women of old before Christ as well as the dead faithful Christians who were not in the class of the “Little Flock” will be raised to life at the resurrection of the dead to become heirs of and great rulers in God’s Kingdom on earth. – Job 19:25; Isaiah 32:1; Matthew 8:11,12; Luke 14:13,14; Hebrews 11:32-40.
    
     
    
    The Bible gives the understanding that the final end of this evil world will be marked by the greatest tribulation and conflict that the world has ever known – “the battle of the great day of God Almighty”. “For then shall be great tribulation”, said Jesus Christ, “such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.” (Matthew 24:21) It is during this battle that the Devil and all his invisible and visible followers – the demons and the willfully wicked persons – will be destroyed by God through Jesus Christ and his holy army. – Daniel 12:1; 2 Thessalonians 1:7-9; Revelation 20:1-3.
    
     
    
    According to the Bible, there will be a “great multitude” of faithful Christians whom no man could number that will survive the battle of the Lord and enter the third world – The World Without End. – Daniel 12:1; John 8:51; Revelation 7:9, 10, 13-15.
    
     
    
    The Millennium which is the reign of Jesus Christ for a thousand years, will begin after the battle of the great day. (Revelation 20:4,6) It at this time that there will be a general resurrection of the just and unjust. While the just will be rewarded with everlasting life in the bliss of paradise on earth, the unjust, who either did not serve God before their death or worshipped Him but not in truth, will be punished according to their sins. (Daniel 12:1-3; John 5:28,29; Acts 24:15; Hebrews 9:27) Period of punishment for each of them will be one hundred years. (Isaiah 65:20; 2 Timothy 4:1; 1 Peter 4:5,6) This serves as a second chance for them to know God, show their obedience and subjection to Him and Christ; and it all bespeaks the justice and mercy of God. Any of them who proves obedient will at the end of the 100 years be given eternal life but the disobedient ones will be sentence to the “second death”, which means everlasting destruction. – Isaiah 65:20; Revelation 20:12-15; 21:8.
    
     
    
    The millennium is also a period of reconstruction when all the vestiges of the old world will be removed and the earth rebuilt into a paradise like the beautiful garden of Eden. (Isaiah 60:13; Ezekiel 36:33-38) When the work of reconstruction shall have been completed at the end of the 1000 years, then Jesus Christ will, as a faithful Son, handover the entire Kingdom to his Father, Jehovah, that, in the language of St Paul, “God may be all in all.” – 1 Corinthians 15:24-28.
    
     
    
    The New World
    
    It is this glorious Kingdom that is the New World God promised His faithful worshippers. The beauties of it cannot be described enough in human words. There shall be no oppression, injustice, bribery and corruption or any form of unrighteousness. Even among the beast there shall be peace and harmony; “the wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid” and so forth. Yes, there shall be peace, joy and concord everywhere! – Isaiah 11:6-9; 65:17-25.
    
     
    
    These wonderful facts of the Scriptures have been described as “the hidden wisdom” which the rulers and intellectual of the world do not know. (1 Corinthians 2:7,8) The reward of the righteous will be great. “Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.” Said St Paul. “But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.” – 1 Corinthians 2:9,10.
    
     
    
    St Peter spoke of God’s Kingdom as the “new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness”. (2 Peter 3:13) And St John who saw a vision of the New World, described it thus “And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea (that is, wickedness in a spiritual parable). And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband…And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things (in the present evil world) are passed away…” – Revelation 21:1-5
    
     
    
    With the understanding of the foregoing, no one who is spiritually inclined will fail to appreciate while the faithful have always served God in truth and laboured assiduously as to prove worthy of the New World, or while Christ asked his disciples to pray for the Kingdom to come. – Matthew 6:9,10; John 4:23,24; 8:31-32,36.
    
     
    
    That God’s perfect Kingdom is immovable and that it the only hope of distressed humanity is beyond all doubt. We therefore remind all Christians of St Paul exhortation, to wit: “Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear.” – Hebrews 12:28`,

    content:`WHAT does God‟s Kingdom Society (GKS) stand for? How, when and by whom was she founded? What precisely is her mission? And what are her doctrines? These are some of the questions often asked by people. Many of them ask with a sincere desire to know the truth, but some others do merely to find fault. Whatever the motive of anyone, the facts, no doubt, are of vital interest to unprejudiced, honest people.

 

    There is nothing in the history of the GKS for which we the members should be ashamed. It is a record of happenings that confirm the time-honoured truth that what God has planted no one can uproot. And so, we have every cause, rather, to glory in the Lord.
    
     
    
    The God’s Kingdom Society is a purely Christian Organisation founded by the Almighty God through the instrumentality of the late Gideon Meriodere Urhobo, of the blessed memory. The late G. M. Urhobo, who was the first President of the GKS, with just an instrument chosen by God through Jesus Christ, according to the election of grace, to accomplish His purpose. – Matthew 24: 31; Acts 15: 14-18; 10: 9-35; James. 1: 18.
    
     
    
    Any religion or faith is literally organised by man but spiritually either by God Who moves and directs the man through His Spirit or by the devil. And we “know them by their fruits”. – Romans 6: 16; Matthew 7: 15-20.
    
     
    
    As a matter of fact, there is no religious organisation that can claim that God Himself came down to this earth to set it up. God has always used men, as He pleases, to carry out His will. Jesus Christ himself, when he was on earth, said: “For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of Him (God) that sent me.” – John 6: 38.
    
     
    
    Also, the early apostles of Jesus Christ were practical examples of people chosen by God to be His vessels. All the spiritual gifts and powers manifest in them and which they exerted in the work of the ministry were derived from the Almighty Father. For that reason, the glory, honour and praise of their successes must be ascribed to God who, by His grace, fitted them to their several uses.
    
     
    
    Said St. Paul, “Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man. I have planted, Apollos watered: but God gave the increase, So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase…” -1 Corinthians 3: 5-10.
    
     
    
    History
    
    The history of the God’s Kingdom Society is linked with the biography of her first President, Brother G. M. Urhobo, in respect of his career as a preacher of the gospel. He hailed from Urhobo tribe and was the second son of a kind pagan gentleman-the late Ukoli of Agbassa village in Warri, Midwestern State of Nigeria. He was educated at the Warri Government School, and he taught in Roman Catholic schools as well as the Government school, Warri, in the twenties. In June 1930, he joined the Posts and Telegraphs Department as a postal clerk and telegraphist.
    
     
    
    Undoubtedly, his strong inclination for divine knowledge fired his interest in the Holy Bible which he spent most of his time to study. The most significant experience of his life came when he fell into a trance and received the Lord’s commission. It was this remarkable occurrence that brought about the radical change in his life from a civil servant to an adroit preacher of the gospel! There was never a time he equivocated with regard to his spiritual calling; rather, he ever so well made open declarations about the grace the Lord bestowed upon him-and he lived up to it. Here is his own testimony:
    
    “After three and half years’ diligent and prayerful studies of the Holy Bible, Jesus Christ revealed himself to me in a vision and commanded me to go and proclaim the good news of God’s Kingdom (or ‘Gospel of Peace’) to all nations as the only remedy for all human sufferings and woes; to expose all the false doctrines which Satan had used to deceive the people and to keep them in ignorance of God’s Kingdom and purpose of creation; and to pronounce God’s written judgment against all wickedness.”
    
     
    
    Under the circumstances, it was virtually impossible for him to continue to serve under the Nigerian Colonial Government. He had no other alternative than to obey the Lord’s command, like St. Paul of Bible fame (Acts 26: 12-20), and devote his life wholly to Christ’s Ministry as “the Lord’s freeman”. So, in February 1933, he resigned from the Government Service and became a full-time Minister of the gospel of Christ. This was quite in harmony with the biblical injunction, which says: “For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord’s freeman: Likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ’s servant. Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men ” – 1 Corinthians 7: 22, 23.
    
     
    
    The resignation of Brother G. M. Urhobo from the civil service for no other reason than that he, being anointed by the Lord, was going to give his whole time to God’s Kingdom service, gave cause for his own relatives and many of his colleagues and friends to view his sanity with suspicion. It was really difficult for the unspiritual to appreciate his decision and course of action in throwing to the winds, for the love of preaching as some said, such an enviable post in the Government Service in those days when men of his social rank were regarded as the elites of society!
    
     
    
    Right from the start of his career as a preacher, Brother Urhobo became an object of hatred and reproach as Christ truly said would happen to the chosen ones. (John 15: 18, 19; 17: 14-16). His relatives and friends forsook him. Some said he was mad; others called him a devil and deceiver just as Jesus Christ, the Redeemer of mankind, was called. (John 10: 20). Many false reports about him were published and circulated by certain people and the Watchtower Society warning the people to avoid him because of his teachings, which they considered to be revolutionary.
    
     
    
    His worst antagonists were among the members of the Watchtower Society and the Roman Catholic Church
    
     
    
    Owing to the persecution in Warri he went to Sapele in June 1933. There, too, it was not all roses for him. His expository lectures in which he criticised the false doctrines of “churchianity” stirred great enmity of the clergymen against him
    
     
    
    Urhobo vs Brown
    
    In October 1934, Brother Urhobo went to Lagos where, owing to his interest in the publications of the late J. F. Rutherford – former President of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of America-he came in contact with the late W. R. Brown, the local representative of the Watchtower Society in Nigeria.
    
     
    
    Later on, there was a disagreement between Brother Urhobo and Mr. Brown over the issues of doctrine. Brother Urhobo had in a biblically constructive argument, for the purpose of correction (2 Timothy 3: 16, 17), called the attention of Mr. Brown to certain errors in the teachings of the Watchtower Society about “Marriage”, “Jehovah’s Organisation”, “Selection and ordination of the 144,000 Anointed Christians”, “Leadership”, “Memorial Supper”, “Women Preaching” and their fixing dates for “Armageddon”.
    
     
    
    Instead of Mr. Brown to allow the Spirit of Christ to dominate his reason as to consider the correction of Brother Urhobo from a scriptural stand-point, he lost his temper. Yes, King Solomon said, “He that is soon angry dealeth foolishly.” (Proverbs. 14: 17) And St. James stated, “For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.” – James. 1: 20.
    
     
    
    The honourable course open to Brother Urhobo was to part company with Mr. Brown whose teachings, he pointed out were inconsistent with the Scripture. It is those doctrinal issues that are the base of the vast gulf still existing between the God’s Kingdom Society and the Watchtower Society whose members call themselves” Jehovah’s Witnesses”.
    
     
    
    GKS Organised
    
    It was in Lagos in that same year 1934 Brother Urhobo, through his soul-stirring public lectures, attracted a handful of adherents whom he, through the Spirit of God, organised into a group of Bible students. And it was that group that has grown steadily by God’s grace, into thousands of Christians allover Nigeria and abroad, in spite of stiff opposition and tribulations of the devil and become a mighty Christian Organisation known, today, as GOD’S KINGDOM SOCIETY. This precisely fulfils the Bible: “A little one shall become a thousand, and a small one a strong nation: I the Lord will hasten it in his time.” – Isaiah. 60: 22; see also Matthew 13: 31, 32.
    
     
    
    The members of the Watchtower Society having failed in their attempt to hinder the progress of the GKS, resorted to a campaign of callumny. They called Brother Urhobo a devil, Judas, man of sin, thief, prisoner, a withered branch, and such like contrary to the Bible. (Matthew 5: 43-45) They are not ashamed that the man whom they always called a “withered branch” was more virile in preaching the gospel than they; and the GKS, which is the fruit of his labour, continues to grow by leaps and bounds through the grace of God in fulfilment of the Bible. – Psalm 105: 24; 115: 11, 13-15; Isaiah. 9: 6, 7.
    
     
    
    We are sometimes amused when we hear some people talk glibly about the God’s Kingdom Society. They ask, “How can it be the church of God when it was founded by man?” They add, “The GKS sprang from the Watchtower Society; we knew the founder very well: it was the late G. M. Urhobo who was an ordinary postal clerk.”
    
     
    
    It is those who have no spiritual understanding that look down on the work of God on carnal or worldly considerations. We do not know of any church denomination, we reiterate, that God Himself came down from heaven to establish on earth. The Roman Catholic Church cannot make such a claim. Even their claim that it was founded by St. Peter is scripturally unsustainable. Historically, the influence of pagan Rome on that church is common knowledge. We need not go into details as to why people who had no spiritual light became “rulers of the church from outside”.
    
     
    
    The Church of England split or sprang from the Roman Catholic Church. Under Henry VIII, the break with the papacy became complete.
    
     
    
    The Lutherans started with Martin Luther and the Presbyterians with John Calvin. And was it not John Wesley, after graduation and ordination as a priest in the Church of England, that founded the Methodist Church? What about the Salvation Army? Was it not founded by William Booth, a Methodist minister, in the East End of London in 1865?
    
     
    
    Are the Baptists not successors of the Anabaptists who seceded formally from the Church of England in 1633. and “among their early and most distinguished names are those of Milton and Bunyan”? (Vide Jack’ s Reference Book, page 839).
    
     
    
    The Adventists of which the Seventh- Dav Adventists is just a body, started in North America with William Miller, a Baptist minister.
    
    Russell vs Barbour
    
    Finally, let us take a look at the Watchtower Society whose members are most vociferous in making bombastic claims and scandalising others. They claim that theirs is “Jehovah’s Organsation”, but who founded it? It was founded by Charles Taze Russell at Pittsburgh, Pa., in America. And what was he before then? A Watchtower publication, Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Divine Purpose, has this to say: “Russell was in partnership with his father, assisting him with his business activity in a men’s furnishing store…he abandoned it all to devote his entire time to the ministry,” (Page 17).
    
     
    
    The book stated that “in 1876, while Pastor Russell was in Philadelphia on a business trip, he happened to come into possession of a copy of the magazine The Herald of the Morning” being published by N. H. Barbour of Rochester. N. Y. He was pleased and interested because of the similarity of their views “even though be recognized it as an Adventist paper”. He got in touch with Barbour to arrange a meeting at his (Russell’s) expense in order to discuss matters. “He was satisfied with the evidence Barbour presented.” The book continues; “As a result of Russell’s meeting with Barbour, his study group in Pittsburgh became affiliated with the group at Rochester…” (Page 18)
    
     
    
    It is interesting to note that a division soon arose between Russell and Barbour because of differences on scriptural points. This resulted in Russell’s breaking away, The Watchtower publication quotes Russell as stating among other things; “Therefore, after a most careful though unavailing effort to reclaim the erring, I withdrew entirely from The Herald of the Morning, and from further fellowship with Mr., Barbour.” (Pages 20-21, emphasis ours).
    
     
    
    What moral right, therefore, have the Watchtower witnesses to point accusing fingers at Brother G. M. Urhobo for parting company with Mr. Brown and the Watchtower Society on doctrinal grounds?
    
     
    
    However, the point we are making in our reference to other religious bodies is that none of them is in a better position than the God’s Kingdom Society to claim to be God’s Organisation. But judged by the standard of morals, disciple and, above all, the preaching of the truth of God as contained in the Bible, we, like St. Paul recommend the GKS to “every man’s conscience in the sight of God”. The GKS does not, however, claim to be the only true church organisation in the whole world. We say all this not out of ill-will or animosity but for the purpose of enlightenment.
    
     
    
    The fact that Brother Gideon Urhobo was an African or a postal clerk was no reason why God would not use him to do His work. Late President Rutherford of the Watchtower Society stated in his booklet, Favored People, that the blessings of God have no reference whatsoever to nationalities;. He wrote: “The blackest man from Africa will have the same opportunity as the white man of America. ” (Page 7).
    
     
    
    The early apostles of Jesus Christ were common men but it pleased God to make them His workmen. If God could choose a fisherman to be an apostle, is it a postal clerk He could not call to labour in the gospel? (Matthew 4:18-22; Acts 4; 13) There is a popular hymn having this stanza:
    
    Not many rich or noble called,
    
    Not many great or wise;
    
    Those whom God makes His kings and priests
    
    Are poor in human eyes.
    
     
    
    This was drawn from the first epistle of St. Pauls to the Corinthians in which he made it clear that it is those the world regards as foolish and base God chooses to do His work. He wrote: “For ye see your calling, brethren, bow that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called: but God hath chosen the – foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; and base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are: that no flesh should glory in His presence.” – 1 Corinthians 1: 26-29.
    
     
    
    So when some people say contemptuously that the first President of the GKS did not go to Europe or America or university, we do not bother ourselves because we know that they are spiritually ignorant. The reproaches, malicious misrepresentations, slanders and persecutions of men have never stayed God’s blessings from descending upon the GKS. St. Paul was so reproached and branded a heretic, yet he told Felix: “But this I confess unto thee that after the way which they (his accusers) call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets.” – Acts 24: 14.
    
     
    
    Success.
    
    The success of Brother Gideon Urhobo is no longer in dispute. Today the God’s Kingdom Society, no matter whatever view anyone holds, reflects the glory of God and stands as an everlasting monument, by the grace of God, of Brother Gideon M. Urhobo-an illustrious son of Africa!
    
     
    
    With regard to the mission of the GKS, the following extracts from her Constitution are explicit enough:
    
    “(a) To declare God’s Kingdom of righteousness and peace on earth and to express this doctrine in every conceivable way and form, within the bounds of law, order and human decency and to do so at any time or place, to the best of our knowledge and understanding of Bible interpretations and symbolism.
    
    “(b) To vindicate, admonish, preach and impart to mankind irrespective of colour, creed or caste the wholesome idea of service, fear, adoration and reverence to God Almighty, the Maker of Man, the Author of Life, and the Great Ruler and Architect of the Universe, and for this purpose always to organise meetings and gatherings in any corner of the street, road, house or premises, in any township, village or locality without harm, violence nor damage to any person or property and without infringement of any laws or regulations of any constitutional authority of Government.
    
    “(c) To excite the interest of Africans and all peoples of the earth to the study of the Holy Bible, the Christian ethics and theology and to promote all means and measures conducive to the propagation of this knowledge for the eventual peace and realisation of harmony and tranquility among all people of the human race in accordance with scriptural ideology.”
    
     
    
    We have published this in the interest of the readers who have been asking to know more about the God’s Kingdom Society. Yes, the GKS is planted by God; it is not the work of man. Therefore, anyone persecuting her is “fighting against God”. – Acts 5: 29-42; Luke 10: 16; Mark 9: 41, 42; Hebrews 10: 31; 12: 29.`,

    content:`THE union of a man and a woman as husband and wife is known as marriage. It was instituted by the Almighty God not only for the accomplishment of His purpose but also for the benefit of men and women. In all the ways human beings have connections there is none – apart from the point of faith – the ties of which are stronger than the marriage bond.

 

    According to the Holy Bible, both man and woman are the creation of the Most High. From ‘the dust of the ground’, He made the first man Adam in His own image and endowed him with the attributes of wisdom, power, justice and love. And God said: “It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.” – Genesis 2: 18.
    
     
    
    It is worthy of note that the Omniscient, who knows the end from the beginning, took to a different process in bringing the woman into existence. He caused Adam to fall into a deep sleep, and took out one of his ribs to make a woman whom He gave to Adam to be his wife. Adam, having awaked out of sleep, did not vacillate between two opinions as to his fleshly connection with his wife but straight off he identified her saying: “This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.” – Genesis 2: 21-23.
    
     
    
    Thus Adam and Eve became the first human couple from whom the entire race of mankind descended. It is the will of God that the marital union should be kept sacred from infraction and that its strength should be maintained at all times. For this reason, it is written: “Therefore shall a man (for the sake of marriage) leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh. ” – Genesis 2: 24.
    
     
    
    We have now seen how marriage originated. Since then men and women have been marrying as ordained by the Lord. And because of the importance He attaches to marriage He enacted laws to regulate it. The law, according to Leviticus chapter 18, forbids a man from contracting marriage with a woman who is his near relation.
    
     
    
    The two principal reasons why God made the woman for the man and allowed them to get married, are (1) that the woman should be a helper or partner of the man (Genesis 2: 20-24); and (2) that they both should multiply and fill the earth with children. – Genesis 1: 27, 28.
    
     
    
    It is very important that every man or woman understands the purpose of marriage as well as the position each one holds in the union. Many marriages have run upon the rocks and collapsed because the parties concerned lacked this understanding. They do not appreciate its
    
    sacredness.
    
    Equal Rights?
    
    Some people hold the wrong view that in a marriage contract both the man and the woman have equal rights. According to The American Peoples Encyclopedia (Vol. 12, page 1077), “American laws and customs have tended to greater and greater equality between husband and wife in the marriage contract.” This is very wrong.
    
     
    
    There was never a time God, Who instituted marriage, indicated that man and woman were equal partners. When Adam and Eve sinned God, in passing His sentence, told the woman: “I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.”- Genesis 3: 16.
    
     
    
    What is more, St. Paul stated: “But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man…. ” (1 Corinthians 11: 3).
    
     
    
    The married woman must acknowledge the man as her head and give him that due respect. She too is vested with some rights or privileges of respect, honour, and trust which the man, though as the head, is bound to acknowledge and show to her. (Read 1 Corinthians 11: 3-12) St. Paul further explained that it is the woman that God made for the man, and not the man for the woman. Man is the image of God but the woman is the glory of the man. The man, he said, cannot do without the woman as she too cannot do without the man whom God had made to be her ruler and head.
    
     
    
    For any woman, therefore, to claim equality with her husband in the face of these scriptural authorities is a clear case of presumptuousness-and it is a sin (Deuteronomy 17: 12, 13; Psalm 19: 13) the woman must not usurp authority over the man. – 1 Timothy 2: 11-14.
    
     
    
    On the other hand any man who is so spineless to the extent of subjecting himself to the domination of his wife, is acting contrary to the divine purpose. St. Paul stated positively that an effeminate-that is, a womanish man or a man ruled by his wife-has no place in the Kingdom of God. – 1 Corinthians 6: 9, 10.
    
     
    
    We have said earlier that a married woman deserves to be respected but this respect must not be carried to the extreme of turning the husband nearly to a house- boy. What some so-called gentlemen regard as an act of “respect for the Mistress” is sheer stupidity. Woman is not man’s equal. Patricia Fay Anderton, a London woman, was quite right when she stated: “God never intended men and women to be equal; He certainly never intended women to compete with men. A woman is the complement to man… comforting and caring for him, and her true place is by his side not as a working competitor.” (West African Pilot, April 13, 1957).
    
     
    
    Dignity
    
    Marriage in its true perspective enhances the prestige and dignity of both the man and the woman. It was King Solomon who said, “Whoso findeth a wife (the godly type) findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favour of the Lord.” (Proverbs. 18: 22) And St. Paul stated: “Marriage is honourable; let us all keep it so, and the marriage-bond inviolate; for God’s judgment will fall on fornicators and adulterers.” – Hebrews 13: 4. New English Bible.
    
     
    
    Some people consider marriage as obsolete. Since unmarried women are very many and they can get some of them to satisfy their lusts at any time, it is, in their opinion, unwise to get themselves tied in matrimony to particular women. Another reason why they hate to get married is that they do not want to shoulder the responsibilities marriage imposes on men.
    
    There are also the female counterparts of this sort of unprincipled men, who prefer a life of debauchery to that of honourable marriage. All of them, except they repent, stand condemned before God and before men of honour for allowing themselves to be used as tools by the devil in carrying out his will in opposition to God and constituting a menace to human societies. In the end, the fate of the lawless will be their lot. – l Timothy 1: 9-10; Romans 1: 28-32.
    
    With regard to young women St. Paul advised: “1 will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.” – l Timothy 5: 14.
    
     
    
    We must admit that the married life of certain people leaves much to be desired. What joy or comfort is in a marriage where the husband and wife behave like a cat and dog in the home? Some men are so high-tempered that for almost every misdeed of the wife, no matter how trivial, he is prepared to administer strokes of the cane or a heavy blow on her, or engage her in a fight. Similarly, some women are rude, very stubborn, like a devil incarnate, and ill mannered so that they count it as sport not only to irritate their husbands with abusive words and provocative conduct but also to invite them to open duels. Once a situation such as this becomes the order of the day in a married home then all that marriage stands for is gone.
    
     
    
    But the point is that the fault is not in the institution but on those misfits who neither understand the purpose of marriage nor appreciate the essence of the nuptial ties.
    
     
    
    Virtuous Woman
    
    A married woman who realises that she is a helper to her husband must do things to give him comfort and pleasure. She should show interest in her housework and should be humble, sober, discreet and chaste. (Titus 2: 4, 5) King Solomon said that a virtuous woman does not eat the bread of idleness, but is industrious; and she cares for her household so much that the evidence of her care is noticed in her husband among people. “She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness. Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her. ” – Proverbs. 31: 10 – 28.
    
     
    
    It was in view of all this, King Solomon also stated: “A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband: but she that maketh ashamed is as rottenness in his bones.” -Proverbs 12: 4.
    
     
    
    It is not education, offering of gifts to curry neither favour nor beauty that makes marriage a success but good manners based on the fear of God. “Favour is deceitful”, said Solomon, “and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised.”-Proverbs. 31: 30.
    
     
    
    In his admonition to married women St. Paul wrote: “Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the Church: and he is the saviour of the body. Therefore as the Church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.” -Ephesians 5: 22-24; see also Colossians. 3: 18; 1 Peter 3: 1-6.
    
     
    
    Although God said that the desire of the wife should come from the husband (Genesis 3: 16) that is no reason why the wife should be a spendthrift. She should be able to live according to the means and social status of her husband. The Bible says: “Every wise woman buildeth her house: but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands.” – Proverbs. 14: 1.
    
     
    
    Responsibilities
    
    On the part of the husband, marriage entails a lot of responsibilities. That is why a man must count the cost before plunging into it. The husband should be God-fearing, knowledgeable and understanding enough as to be able to rule his wife and control the affairs of his home.
    
     
    
    Husbands are required to love their wives, and they should not be bitter against them. (Colossians 3: 19) They should look after their wives well and nourish them in order to make them happy and appear decent: for the woman is the glory of the man. Said St. Paul: “Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the Church, and gave himself for it ….So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself. For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the Church.” – Ephesians 5: 25-29, 33.
    
     
    
    It is an offence for a man to oppress or maltreat his wife. The seriousness of this is underscored by the fact that the prayer of such a man will not be answered by God. St. Peter therefore admonished: “Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.” – 1 Peter 3: 7.
    
     
    
    With regard to the purpose of reproduction, it is important that a good understanding exists between the husband and the wife. St. Paul’s advice on this matter is enough. He stated: “The husband must give the wife what is due to her, and the wife equally must give the husband his due. The wife cannot claim her body as her own; it is her husband’s. Equally, the husband cannot claim his body as his own; it is his wife’s. Do not deny yourselves to one another, except when you agree upon a temporary abstinence in order to devote yourselves to prayer; afterwards you may come together again; otherwise for lack of self-control, you may be tempted by Satan.” (1 Corinthians 7:3-5, New English Bible) It is a SIN and an abuse of marriage honour for the wife to have love connection with a man who is not her husband; so too it is a sin for the husband to have sexual relation with any woman who is not his wife.
    
     
    
    European Custom
    
    In certain religious circles it is believed that a man and a woman are not properly married except a priest officiates at the marriage ceremony and the man gives the woman a ring. This is what some people call Christian marriage.
    
     
    
    According to the Book of Common Prayer, the “solemnization of matrimony” takes a process involving open declarations by both the priest and the parties contracting the marriage. At a stage, the priest delivers the ring to the man who puts it upon the fourth finger of the woman‟s left hand, saying:
    
    “With this ring I thee wed, with my body I thee worship,
    
    and with all my worldly goods I thee endow…”
    
     
    
    The word “worship” here is improper as it is very unscriptural. It is only God true Christians worship. The husband should not worship his wife and the wife must not worship her husband. In the Christian Religion, man does not worship man save God and Christ alone. – Matthew 4: 10; 20:20; Hebrews1: 5, 6.
    
     
    
    To say the least, this system of wedding with the ring and worshipping the wife is a European custom garnished with religious formalities. It is the tendency of the white missionaries in introducing some of their customs to their African adherents under the cloak of “Christianity” that makes certain Africans wrongly call Christianity the whiteman’s religion.
    
     
    
    We challenge anyone to cite a precedent in the Bible to show that a priest ever officiated at a marriage ceremony as the priests of “churchianity” are doing or that a ring has anything to do with the marriage of Christ’s disciples.
    
    There was a marriage feast in Cana of Galilee which Jesus Christ and his disciples attended in his days on earth. He did not perform any function of uniting people in a “holy wedlock”. All he did was his first miracle of turning water into wine. – John 2: 1-11.
    
     
    
    It is the responsibility of parents to give out their daughter to whom they will according to their own customs which do not contravene God’s laws.
    
     
    
    African Christians can marry according to their customs and Europeans, Americans or Asians according to theirs, provided those customs, we repeat, do not violate the laws of God. It is wrong for white missionaries to impose their customs on Africans in the name of Christianity. And for the African to ape the whiteman’s customs in the name of modernism is shameful. To despise any custom, which is not contrary to the Scriptures, just because it is African, is sinful. God is against despite. (Proverbs. 14: 21; 11: 12) African Christians can break their kola nuts and drink their palm wine during marriage negotiations and feasts; it is no sin. But they should not pour libations to the gods or ancestors. (Deuteronomy 6: 14,15) Christians have and serve one God-the Almighty God-through Jesus Christ. (1 Timothy 2: 5) Ancestors can neither help nor bless one’s marriage. The Bible says that the dead know not anything. – Ecclesiastes 9: 5,6.
    
     
    
    Church Role
    
    The role of the Church, which the pastor or any elder of the church can play, is to guide, advise and charge the contracting parties as regards the solemnity and sanctity of marriage which must be maintained in order not to contravene God’s laws and so that He (God) may bless the marriage.
    
     
    
    Before concluding, we must stress once again that the relationship between husband and wife must be kept inviolate. Neither the husband nor the wife has the right to break their marriage at will. They must not allow extraneous influence or unnecessary interference from parents, relatives or friends to disrupt their home. The saying that “they shall be one flesh” is but an emphasis signifying the strong relationship that must exist between husband and wife. Jesus Christ said: “What therefore God hath joined together let no man put asunder.” (Matthew 19: 4-6) And God said through St. Paul: “Let not the wife depart from her husband: but and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife.” – 1 Corinthians 7: 10, 11.
    
     
    
    What is important in marriage is not the joy and zest with which one enters into it but the understanding and ability to sustain it in the fear of God. Men and women should be educated and encouraged to marry, and to endeavour to build up a happy home to the Lord’s glory.
    
    The burning question as to whether it is lawful for a Christian to marry more than one wife shall, by the grace of God, be treated in the next issue of “The Weekly Sermon”.`,
