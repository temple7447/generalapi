    Categories: `CAN CHRISTIANS JUDGE ONE ANOTHER??`,
    content: `THAT it is virtually impossible to preach the truth of the gospel of Christ without condemning evil or exposing falsehood is an indisputable fact. Any preaching, therefore, that does not come in conflict with the works of error is not the gospel of Jesus Christ.
    In any issue on which opinions of men differ from one another the reasonable thing to do in order to resolve it is to resort to an authority upon which all can safely rely. If it is a matter in a court of justice and a point of law is involved, a legal authority must be found in order to decide as to which of the divergent views is right. So too if it is a matter about the Christian faith, doctrine or principle, we must depend on the Holy Bible for a solution.
    The mistake many people make is that they are too prone to rush into conclusions on spiritual matters about which personal opinions are of no consequence. They do not care to ascertain as to whether the view they hold is in accord with the Word of God. It was King Solomon who said: “Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths. Be not wise in thine own eyes…” – Proverbs 3:5-7.
    The question as to whether Christians can judge or criticise one another is one of those issues about which people hold different views. Only last week, a friend told a member of the God’s Kingdom Society: “I like the GKS because they are preaching the truth. But they should preach their own without criticising other churches.” That apart, a certain clergyman, having received a copy of The Weekly Sermon, said a similar thing about the GKS but added: “The Bible says, judge not.”
    On this question of criticism or judgment, there is no support in the Scriptures for the view that Christians should not judge or criticise one another. Rather there is abundance of evidence to the contrary.
    The Text
    The text often referred to by our critics is Matthew chapter 7, verse 1, where it is written: “Judge not, that ye be not judged.”
    We agree that Jesus Christ made this statement. But the interpretation some people give to it is very wrong and misleading. Christ himself gave its interpretation in verses 2, 3, 4 and 5, but many people have not the patience to read these verses, let alone understand them. He did not mean that we should not judge or criticise at all. Rather, he meant that before we judge we should make sure that we are in a position to do so in the sense that we ourselves are free from the fault for which we judge others. For if we too are guilty of what we criticise in others, they also will in return point accusing fingers at us.
    In verse 2, Jesus continued: “For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged; and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.” This will happen when the person who judges another is equally guilty in that as he criticises or treats others so too they will do to him, he being not free.
    And in verses 3 and 4, Jesus- Christ threw more light on the point when he further said: “And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?”
    It is possible some may still be in doubt as regards the intention of Christ or misconstrue the whole illustration; so he reprimanded those who always see others’ faults and not theirs, and positively stated what Christians should do, as it is written: “Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother’s eye”
    According to the whole tenor of his illustration there is no justification whatsoever for the conclusion that Christ is against criticism. Contrariwise, it is clear that we can judge others of their errors provided we correct ourselves and put away our own. By this standard a thief is not qualified to criticize another person who steals, and an adulterer is not in a position to judge another person who commits fornication when he himself has not fully repented otherwise he will be regarded as a hypocrite.
    In support of this principle as established by Jesus Christ, St. Paul stated that whoever condemns sin in others and do the very same thing has no defence at all but condemns himself. He declares: “Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judges; for wherein thou judgest another, thou consdemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things” – Romans 2:1.
    Character of Jesus
    When a thing is wrong Christians should have the boldness to say it is wrong; and when they see the truth let them say it and stand by it. This was the character of Jesus Christ when he was on earth.  He criticized the Pharisees and Sadducees for their false claims and exposed their evil practices. When he crossed swords with the Sadducees on the question of resurrection, he told them bluntly: “Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.” – Matthew 22:29.
    On a certain occasion when Jesus censured the Pharisees and they took offence, his disciples asked him: “Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?” Christ answered at once: “Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up, Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.” – Matthew 15:12-14.
    It is because people fear to say the truth or to condemn what they know to be evil that the world is sinking more and more in iniquity. Many religious leaders who claim to be vicars, apostles, bishops, chief imams, and so forth connive at the evil doings of their followers, particularly the nobles among them, because of their tendencies of seeking to please men rather than being faithful to God.
    The tribulation in Nigeria today has been blamed on the excesses of politicians during the civilian regime. But when, among the politicians and others, there were glaring cases of oppression, bribery and corruption, adultery, mischief-making. deliberate falsehood, drunkenness and so on, what did their spiritual leaders do to rebuke their sins or evil deeds and warn them against the danger they were exposing the nation to, and God’s judgment and punishment that could eventually follow? And since trouble erupted it is these same religious leaders who adopted an attitude of dumbness over sin that are now most vocal, in their” usual act of sanctimoniousness, in a frantic bid for prayers. Can God hear our prayers when we have not repented of our sins and are not sober? “Behold, the Lord’s hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot bear; but your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you that he will not hear…” – Isaiah 59: 14.
    However, we trust that the good Lord will for His name’s sake spare this Republic so that His innocent children may have a free course to serve Him in love.
    The stand of the GKS for the truth and righteousness of God is admired by many people, but some envy and oppose her. However, the truth always prevails.
    It was interesting to note, as reported in the New Nigerian of August 24, 1966, that the Anglican Archbishop C. J. Patterson “blamed religious leaders for their studied silence” over the situation in Nigeria. He was further quoted as saying in a circular letter to his fold: “We are the devil by the weakness of our divisions which prevent us from speaking unanimously.”
    We appreciate the Archbishop’s courage for accepting blame but the excuse for their weakness is untenable. The divisions among Christians is no justifiable around for any servant of Christ to refrain from discharging his spiritual functions creditably; Unanimity of speaking is not all that is important but rectitude, forth rightness and truth notwithstanding the voice of dissent.
    Teachings
    We do not condemn personalities or individuals. We do not say that all those in other religious groups are devils, and those in the GKS are holy. What we criticize are the teachings and doings which we have found to be unscriptural and therefore erroneous.
    For instance, some teach and make people believe in purgatory whereas Jesus Christ and his early apostles did not teach any such thing. Purgatory is not found anywhere in the Bible. There are those who teach that the soul can never die; but the Bible shows clearly that the soul can die. – Psalm 89: 48; Ezekiel 18: 4; Matthew 10: 28; Acts 3; 23, etc. Others also command their priests not to marry but the Bible says that “a bishop must be the husband of one wife”. (1 Timothy 3:1,2) Certain church groups baptise infants without scriptural authority. There are a lot more that are taught and done falsely in the name of God.
    A teacher of lies is a great danger to human societies because they lead people at the instance of the devil to destruction. (Isaiah 9:16; Jeremiah 14:14; Matthew 15:14) To say that the lies of bogus preachers should not be pointed out or criticized is contrary to the will of God.  It is a duty incumbent on the true servants of Christ to warn people against false prophets. The encounter of St. Paul with Bar-Jesus, a false prophet, in his days is a case in point. St. Paul called him “the child of the devil” and “an enemy of righteousness” Addressing him St. Paul said: “Wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?” The apostle then cursed him in the name and power of the Lord and the false prophet became blind. And when Sergius Paulus, a ruler, saw all that happened, he believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord”  – Read Acts 13:6-13.
    If Christian must not judge one another, then those who say that the GKS is wrong for criticizing others are equally guilty for judging the GKS.
    However, the truth is that there is no church organization that does not judge others; otherwise there would have been no divisions among them. As reported in a Roman Catholic newspaper, the INDEPENDENT (Sept. 5-12, 1964, page 2) “Protestants of all kinds have strong doctrinal differences from Catholics and their orders are generally not recognized by the Catholic Church”.
    Church history is replete with incidents of atrocities committed against people because of their Christian convictions by those who purported to be the “pillar of truth” in Christendom. Why were people like John Wycliffe, John Huss, Martin Luther and a host of others branded as heretics and some of them condemned to the flames?
    Now, after hundreds of years, the Roman Catholic Church has come out to own its faults. In October 1964, the Vatican Council voted by an overwhelming majority that Roman Catholics should ask pardon from other Christians for their share in bringing about disunity. The text of a draft degree passed by the assembly by 2,076 votes to 92, called for “conversion of heart”. The text said: “All have responsibility in one way for the sins of disunity. Roman Catholics therefore ask for pardon of God and of their brethren…” Daily Times, October 8, 1964, page 7).
    The point we are making is that other religious bodies do judge and some overstepped their bounds to condemn souls to death.  But all the GKS is doing, and that with all sincerity, is that of showing the light so that the people may find the way to Christ. We will never go to the extreme of condemning people to death. God says, “Vengeance is mine” – Romans 12:19.
    Written Judgement
    The preaching of the gospel involves the pronouncing of the written judgements of God in the Bible in condemnation of all that answer to unrighteousness. Jesus said that the words he had spoken would judge men in the last day. – John 12:48.
    How can the words spoken by Christ nearly 2,000 years ago judge men in this last day? Yes, it is through the propagation of the gospel by those he has commissioned through the anointing of the Holy Spirit. Indeed, to pronounce the written judgement of God is the honour of the saints in particular, and it is also the duty of the saints’ companions who are partakers of their grace to rebuke sin. – Psalm 149: 7-9; Romans 10:13-15; 1 John 2:27; 1 Corinthians 6:1-3; Jude 14, 15; 1 Timothy 5:20, 22; 2 Timothy 4:1, 2; Titus 1:4-9; etc.
    Whenever the written judgement is preached, being the truth, it brings to light every false way and has a piercing effect against all on the side of error. St. Paul stated: “But we are sure that the judgement of God is according to truth against them which commit such things.” – Romans 2:2, see also Hebrews 4:12.
    There is always a conflict between truth and falsehood. As light exposes what is hidden in darkness so too the truth uncovers or brings to view lies, hypocrisy and all other hidden things of dishonesty. St. Paul warned the Christians to “have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them”. He added: “But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.” – Ephesians 5:11-13.
    For obvious reasons, evil men and those whose teachings are questionable do not want criticism. They always oppose and persecute those preaching the truth. That was why St. Paul said that they preached “the gospel of God with much contention” – 1 Thessalonians 2:1-4.
    There are certain church leaders who warn their adherents not to listen to the lectures of the GKS, and some even dictate to their followers not to read publications of others. Such is an attitude of those whose doctrines are not true.
    It is those who have something to hide that fear to come to the light. Jesus said: “For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.” – John 3:20, 21.
    Any church organization that is preaching the truth will have no cause to fear judgement. The truth is quick and forceful, and it can withstand any acrid test of criticism, and triumph over everything that rises against it by the power of God. Milton, the English Puritan poet, was right when he stated, “Truth IS as ‘impossible to be soiled by any outward touch as the sunbeam”. Also an erstwhile judge of the Supreme Court of, the United States was once reported as saying, “If a religious belief has substance, it can survive criticism, heated and abusive though it may be, with the aid of truth and reason alone;” And Saint Paul in his characteristic straightforwardness wrote: “For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.” – 2 Corinthians 13: 8.
    Criticisms aimed at correcting errors and reproving evils are necessary for progress. “All Scripture is given by the Inspiration of God” said St. Paul, “and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for Correction, for instruction in righteousness: that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.” – 2 Timothy 3: 16, 17.
    The only thing is that our judgment must not be malicious or based on false premises put constructive and just. Said Jesus Christ: “Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.” – John 7: 24.
    On the whole, it has been established beyond all reasonable doubt that Christians can judge or criticise one another in accordance with the Holy Scriptures.
    
    May God bless those who understand and appreciate the truth of His word when told – whether in the form of correction, reproof or rebuke, criticism or judgment, advice or instruction. Amen.`,

    Categories: "CITIES OF REFUGE",
    content: `While the Jews were on their historic journey from Egypt to Canaan, God Almighty commanded them through His servant Moses that when they got to Canaan, they should set aside three cities on either side of the River Jordan to be known as Cities of Refuge.
The six cities were for the benefit of the “manslayer” among the Jews as well as the strangers and sojourners dwelling among them to the end that the strict law of retribution in force at that time will not overtake the person who kills another unknowingly or accidentally.  (Deuteronomy 4:41-43) After the death of Moses, God repeated the command regarding the Cities of Refuge to Joshua in Joshua 20:1-6.  In verses 7-9 the names of the cities designated as Cities of Refuge were given. – See also Joshua 20:9

The command of God Almighty in regard to the Cities of Refuge fore- shadowed matters of great spiritual significance particularly in this age of Christ’s Second Coming.  As St. Paul said “For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope” “Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.” – Romans 15:4.  1 Corinthians 10:11; see also Hebrews 10:1

In these last days when the mysteries of God have been made bare, it has pleased Him to reveal the spiritual significance of the Cities of Refuge. (See Ephesians 3:3-9;Psalm 25:9,14; 1 Corinthians 2:14; etc).  The fact that the City of refuge is for the benefit not only of the natural Jews but for strangers and the sojourners among them shows that its application is universal and not limited to the natural Jews.  It is a provision God has made for mankind in this end of the world for their protection against impending doom.  In the anti-type the cities stand for God’s Kingdom now set up in this end of the world. (Matthew 24:15,16; Hebrews 11:10,11) These are set up through the saints or anointed servants. (Isaiah 62:11-12 ; Isaiah 60:14, Matthew 5:14,15) That three of the cities were located on one side of River Jordan and three on the other side shows that the remnant of the anointed Christians are to be chosen from all parts of the world. (Matthew 24:31)  Because they are places of protection, these “cities” founded through the anointed remnant are called “Mountains” where people of Judae, that is those who love to praise God, shall flee to for safety and protection. (Isaiah 2:2; Matthew 24:15,16) These people of goodwill who love to praise Jehovah are called “birds of the air” in Matthew 13:31,32.
The “manslayer” or murderer refers to people of the world who were doing things contrary to the will of God and therefore by God’s law deserved to die (Ezekiel 18:20; Romans 5:10; Ephesians 2:11-12; 1 John 3:15; Galatians 4:8;1 Timothy 1:9) The ignorant manslayers are men of goodwill who were breaking the law of God and opposing the truth due to ignorance.  These are people who are drawn into an undesirable position because of circumstances over which they had no control: as a result of inherited sin. Such ones are given opportunity for life in exercise of Jehovah’s mercy for the fact that that they were breaking the laws of God in ignorance, unintentionally. All mankind who had not come to the light of Christ are in this abject condition.  St Paul in his letter to Titus clarifies the point further “For we ourselves also were sometime foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.”-Titus 3:3
The stubborn and disobedient ones who deliberately oppose the truth and righteousness of God class themselves as willful manslayers and will be destroyed by God through Jesus Christ (the Avenger of blood).  In this wise, St Paul stated “For if we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins. But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.” – Hebrews 10:26-29.  See also Hebrews 6:4-6; Matthew 12:31,32; 2 Peter 2:20-22.
The Avenger of Blood is Jesus Christ who is Jehovah’s Chief Judge, Field Marshall and Vindicator.  It is through Jesus Christ, God Almighty will destroy Satan the devil and his hosts including all unrepentant sinners from off the surface of the earth. – 2 Thessalonians 1:7-9; Psalm 145:20; 9:17
The elders who judge the manslayer are Jesus Christ, his body members, and their companions. (John 5:22,27; Psalm 149:5-9)  Having become convinced of their evil ways, through the preaching of the truth, the ignorant sinners flee to the antitypical City of Refuge, (the true Church of God) and submit themselves to the judgement of God as expounded by the anointed servants, or their companions and to the ecclesiastical courts in God’s organisation.  Such a one must “declare his cause” that is take his stand on the side of God and repent from his old ways and walk in harmony with the laws of the city of refuge (i.e. the true Church of God) so as to be allowed to remain in the city. In the words of the prophet Isaiah ” for when they judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.” (Isaiah 26:9). When the people obey God by forsaking evil, they are being cleansed spiritually. –Psalm 119:9-11; John 15:3
Jesus Christ had in his days on earth made it clear that the words he had spoken “shall judge men in the last day” – in which we are now living in. (John 12:48). The Lord “shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth.” -;Psalm 96:13.
In the type, the manslayer who is judged by the congregation and found to be worthy to remain in the City of Refuge is required to remain there until the death of the High Priest.  The antitypical High Priest is Jesus Christ. (Hebrews 3:1;9:11) The death of the High Priest symbolises the end of the priestly work on earth. (Revelation 20:7-9).  In 1 Corinthians 15:24-28 St. Paul declared: “Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule, and all authority and power.  For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.  The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.  For he hath put all things under his feet.  But when he saith, All things are put under him, it is manifest that he (God Almighty) is excepted, which did put all things under him.  And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.” (emphasis ours).
This is a warning that no Christian should for any reason “go out of the city of his refuge” thus exposing himself to danger in the hands of the Avenger of Blood. There can be no excuse or remedy for willful disobedience to the Lord’s instructions. See Luke 13: 23-27; 2 Peter 2:20-22;Jeremiah 22:10
This is the time therefore for all men of goodwill to demonstrate their faith in God Almighty and Jesus Christ by fleeing to the Lord’s Organisation (the Church organisation where the truth is preached unadulteratedly) and there continue to seek righteousness and meekness as commanded by God so that they may be spared in the great devastation due to take place at Armageddon. – Zephaniah 2:1-3; Isaiah 55:6,7.`,

    content: `THE BRAZEN SERPENT
        THE salvation of God that would come to all repentant sinners through  Jesus Christ as of grace was, since the days of Moses the prophet, typified by a very significant incident when a serpent of brass was set up for the Israelites.
        The children of Israel were a stubborn people. Because of their faithlessness, in spite of the wonders of the Almighty God they saw in Egypt, they continued to sin. On several occasions while they were journeying to Canaan they provoked God by reason of their abominable deeds, and they were justly punished. But when they repented and turned to God they received mercy.
        One of such occasions was after the death of Aaron when they journeyed from Mount Hor by way of the Red Sea to the land of Edom. And because they grew impatient over the route they began to open their mouths wide I against Heaven. As a result of this God sent dreadful serpents to assail the camp of Israel and I many people were bitten to death.
        Here is the Bible record:
        “And they (the Israelites) journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red Sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way. And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, neither is there any  water; and our soul loatheth this light bread. And the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.”- Numbers 21: 4-6.
        Following this plague the Israelites came to their senses and realised their faults. They went to Moses their leader to confess that they had sinned for speaking against God and against him (Moses). They pleaded with him to pray to the Most High to take away the- serpents from them.
        Moses who was well known for his godly disposition and kind-heartedness and humility, acceded to their request and he interceded on their behalf.
        God heard the prayer of Moses. It was really an easy thing for Him to remove the venomous snakes all at once but He did not. Rather, He commanded Moses, saying, “Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.” – Numbers 21: 8.
        In obedience to the Lord’s instruction, Moses made a serpent of brass and erected it on a pole, “and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.”- Numbers 21: 9.
        
        Significance
        
        All diligent students of the Bible do agree that the whole event which culminated in the erection of the brazen serpent was of great spiritual significance. There is quite a lot to learn from the experience of the Israelites and what God did to relieve them of their pains and to save them from death. Yes, it was Saint Paul who stated: “For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.” – Romans 15: 4.
        Now, let us ask ourselves this question: why was Israel plagued with fiery serpents by the very God of their fathers who had done so much to aid them at the time of their distress and adversity? It is clear from the Bible account that it was because they sinned against God. They were guilty of blasphemy – a very serious offence!
        Today there are people who behave like the faithless Israelites. For every misfortune that befalls them they blame the cause on God.
        When they find themselves in any unfavourable situation they turn round to accuse God-notwithstanding the fact that such a situation is of their own making. There is also the class of those, especially among the intellectuals of the world, who take pride in talking glibly and irreverently about God.
        Men must learn to know that God is not the one responsible for their ills or troubles. The evils or tribulations that often come upon us are either due to our own sins of the devil, taking advantage of our “infirmities being human and especially because of our sensualism, brings them upon us.
        The temptation of Job is a striking example of how the devil can trouble even the man of God with the aim of making the person to curse God and so fallout of His favour. Under such circumstances, the true worshippers of God are required to maintain their integrity in faith as Job himself did, and then cry to God in prayer for help and deliverance. – Job 2: 3; 27: 4, 6; Proverbs 11: 3; James 5: 10,11.
        Salvation
        Speaking in the first person through Isaiah the prophet, God declared: “Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else.” – Isaiah 45: 22.
        In order to fulfil His purpose of saving His people, God had to send His beloved Son, Jesus Christ, to the world not only to serve as a propitiation for the sins of mankind but also to be the Mediator through whom eternal life would be obtained in His glorious Kingdom. – 1 Timothy 2: 4-6; 1 John 2: 1, 2.
        Thus the brazen serpent, which God caused Moses to set up for snake-bitten Jews to look to and which served as a remedy for the plague of poisonous serpents, fore- shadowed Jesus Christ who would in due time be sent to the world  God for all mankind to look to for the healing of their  wounds and for their salvation.
        With this understanding at the back of his mind in regard to his mission on earth, Jesus Christ told Nicodemus concerning himself:
        “And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.”- John 3: 14, 15.
        Jesus Christ further explained the reason why the Heavenly Father has made such a grand arrangement for the benefit of sinful mankind when he said: “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” – John 3: 16.
        We must guard ourselves, by the grace of God, against sin. If the Israelites had not sinned they would not have been plagued. Therefore, sin, which is the transgressing of God’s commandment, is a great danger. “For the wages of sin,” said Saint Paul, “is death: but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”- Romans 6: 23.
        
        Antitypical
        
        It could be recalled that when the brazen serpent was erected on a pole in the days of Moses, the rule was that anyone who was bitten by a serpent would live only on the condition that he looked at the serpent of brass.
        We do know that since the setting up of the brazen serpent was typical, the looking at it was also literal – that is, it was the use of ordinary sight by way of turning the eyes, in the direction of the serpent of brass, of course, with the belief .that by so doing they were carrying out God’s instruction or command. But the case of Jesus Christ being antitypical, we are not expected to see him with our human eyes because he is now invisible being a spirit personality who has been glorified in heaven.
        Then, how do we look to Jesus Christ as to draw a parallel between the typical and antitypical? Christ himself gave the answer when he said, “That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.” (John 3: 15) The key-word in this text is BELIEVETH. In other words what is required is belief or faith in Jesus Christ.
        As a matter of fact, Jesus Christ told Thomas one of his apostles: “Ye believe because you have seen me. Blessed be those who believe though they have never seen me.” (John 20: 29 – Moffatt) What is more, St. Paul stated: “For we walk by “faith, not by sight.” – 2 Corinthians 5: 7.
        So today, the benefits of Christ’s redemption and his salvation are obtainable]e only on the condition that we BELIEVE in him. “He that believeth on the Son (Jesus) hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life: but the wrath of God abideth on him.” John 3: 36.
        However, we must not deceive ourselves in thinking that our mere belief in Jesus Christ while we wallow in sins, indulging in sinful lusts of the eyes and flesh, or when we worship him loosely, will save us. IT WILL NOT. It is when we have IMPLICIT FAITH in and LOVE for him, which will make us keep his commandments unhesitatingly, accept his true doc- trines and abide in the Church organization which preaches his TRUTH unadulteratedly, that we are qualified to claim to have looked to or accepted Christ. – Matthew 7: 21; Luke 6: 46-49; John 14: 15, 21-25; 8: 31-32, 36.
        
        Exalted Jesus
        
        The position of Jesus Christ among the creation of God is unique-it is a position of honour, glory and pre-eminence. We must therefore accept him as our Saviour and exercise implicit faith in him as such.
        Peter the apostle, addressing the council of the Jews, spoke of the greatness of Jesus Christ when he quoted the Hebrew Scriptures which today is called the Old Testament, to wit: “This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.” And he added: “Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.”- Acts 4: 10-12.
        Concerning the exaltation of Jesus Christ, St. Paul also wrote: “Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him (Jesus), and given him a name which is above every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.”- Philippians 2: 9-11.
        Furthermore, St. Paul gave an exhortation to the Hebrew Christians, which, in fact, is directed to every true disciple of Jesus Christ throughout the Christian era. He warned that in running the race of life, we as Christians must put away sin and divest ourselves of the burdens of the world that would impede our spiritual progress. He then admonished, “And let us run with patience the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.”– Hebrews 12: 1,2.
        In the light of the Scripture texts clearly explained in this sermon, we are not left in doubt that our salvation is in our hands. Therefore, “work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.” – Philippians 2: 12.`,

    Categories: "RESURRECTION",
    content: `AMONG the promises of God Almighty, that of the resurrection of the dead is one of the most outstanding showing the greatness of His power and His good purpose towards mankind. It is the pivot upon which rests the hope of Christians concerning the dead, and if not for this hope man cannot count himself as anything better than a beast.
    Resurrection means a rising from the dead, or the act of bringing back to life. It is one of the fundamental doctrines of the Christian faith in the Holy Bible.
    When Adam sinned the sentence of death was passed u p o n him by God. Consequently, his offspring having been born in sin were declared guilty and thus death, which is the penalty of sin, was brought upon the entire human race.-Gen. 3: 17-19; Rom. 5: 12-19; 6- 23.
    To think that this world will continue in sin under the wicked overlordship of the devil forever, is ignorance of the divine purpose. God had promised to set up a new order of things both in heaven and earth-the New World now in the making -in which there shall be nothing evil. Concerning this grand arrangement of God, St. Peter declared: "Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwell- eth righteousness."'- 2 Peter 3: 13.
    The Lord's Promise
    In order that His faithful worshippers who have died may have the golden opportunity of enjoying the bliss of that New World-THE WORLD WITHOUT END- as a reward of their loyalty and services, God promised not only to redeem man from the power of the grave by the resurrection of the dead but also to bring death to an end. He declared: "I will ransom them from the power of the grave: I will redeem them from death: 0 death, I wilI be thy plagues; 0 grave, I will be thy destruction: repentance shall be hid from mine eyes."- Hosea 13: 14.
    The ancient faithful before Christ built their hope upon the Lord's promise. They knew that death was just a temporal state which could not bar them from coming back to receive their reward from God at His appointed time.
    Job, a prophet of God, who underwent fiery temptations at the instance of the devil, spoke of the g r a v c as a biding place and hoped earnestly for the time when God would being about his change at the resurrection. He said: "O that Thou wouldest bide me in the grave, that Thou wouldest keep me secret, until Thy wrath be past, that Thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!" (Job 14. 13) He asked, "If a man die, shall he live again?" Yes, of course. He then went on, "All the days of my appointed time will I wait, (in the grave) till my change come. Thou (God) shalt call, and I will answer Thee: Thou wilt have desire to the work of Thine hands." (Verses 14 and 15)
    Job did not stop at this, for the Spirit of God further moved him into a more positive, prophetic declaration of his belief, thus: "For I know that my redeemer iiveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: and though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God ...... -Job 19: 25-27.
    There is also the instance of the Prophecy of Isaiah concerning the resurrection of the dead. He said: "Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead."- Isa. 26-19.
    That children are also among those to be raised from the dead is a fact having concrete support of the Scriptures. When Herod, the wicked king, massacred innocent children in Bethlehem in his attempt to kill the infant, Jesus, God comforted the bereaved with the assurance that their children would come to life again from the grave termed "the land of the enemy" in fulfilment of His prophecy re- corded in Jeremiah 31: 15-17. See also Matt. 2: 13-18.
    When Jesus Christ came to this earth he confirmed in his teachings that resurrection is a reality. There was an occasion when he crossed swords with the Sadducces on the question of resurrection and defeated them. The Sadducces did not believe in resurrection, and so they asked him: "Master, Mosses said, 'If a man should die childless, his brother shall marry the widow and carry on his brother's family.' Now we knew of seven brothers. The first married and died, and as he was without issue his wife was left to his brother. The same thing; happened with the second, and the third, and so on with all
    
    seven. Last of all the woman died. At the resurrection, then, whose wife will she be, for they had all married her?"-Matt. 22: 23-28; New English Bible
    In his answer, Jesus told them point- blank: "You are mistaken, because you know neither the scriptures nor the power of God. At the resurrection men and women do not marry, but are like angels in heaven.'@-Matt. 22: 29, 30, N. k. B.
    Keys of Hell
    Jesus Christ even made it known that he is the one whom the Heavenly Father had vested with the power to raise the dead. He said: "For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom be 'Will. Verily, verily, I say unto you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall bear the voice of the Son of you: and they that bear shall live." (John 5- 21, 25-27) -A hat was why he told Martha: "I am the resurrection, and the life: be that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live." -John 11: 25.
    He showed an example of the power when Lazarus who had died and had already been four days in the tomb, was raised to life by him.-John 11: 32-45.
    The devil caused Jesus Christ to be killed by wicked men with the intent, no doubt, to defeat the all-important purpose of God. But the Most High, in exercise of His infinite power, raised him from the dead the third day and crowned him with power, glory and honour. Jesus himself declared: "I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for ever- more, Amen, and have the keys of bell and of death." (Rev. 1: 18) The "keys" in this context are, symbolic of the power or authority to release the dead from "hell", that is, the grave; and put an end to death.
    The resurrection of Jesus Christ was a clear demonstration of the certainty of God's promise as regards the rising again of the dead, and has strongly enlivened the hope of all Christians.-I Pet. 1: 3.
    In defense of the Christian faith, the early apostles preached the resurrection from the dead. (Acts 4: 1-4; 17: 18) Because of St. Paul's belief and teaching about it, he suffered persecutions and prosecutions at the hands of the unbelieving J e w a - When he was indicted before king Agrippa he declared: "And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers; u n to which promise our twelve tribes,
    
    instantly serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, King Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews." He then asked, "Why should it be thought a thing in- credible with you, that God should raise the dead?"-Acts 26: 6-8.
    Indisputable Fact
    St. Paul, in his first epistle to the Corinthians, stated that if there was no resurrection then all the preaching and sufferings of Christians were vain. He added: "For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised. If Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sin..., If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable." He proved clearly that resurrection is an indisputable fact. - I Cor. 15: 12-33.
    For anyone, therefore, to have doubt about the possibility of resurrection is an evidence of lack of faith. It was from the dust of the ground God made man, and if man turns, to dust again there is no reason why it should be considered an impossibility for God to bring him back to life.
    But some may ask, "How are the dead raised? And what kind of body will they have?" To such questions St. Paul gave an illustrative answer to the effect that the seed you sow in the ground does not grow into a plant unless it "dies" first. And when the green shoot comes up out of the seed, it is very different from the seed you first planted. For what you sow is just a dry little seed, perhaps of wheat, or some other kind. "But God giveth it a body as it bath pleased Him, and to every seed his own body ... So also is the resurrection of the dead", said St. Paul. "It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.' I Cor. 15: 35-43.
    One salient point which some people seldom consider is that it is not only the righteous that will be resurrected but the wicked as well. And everyone will be rewarded by God according to his works good or bad. It is an understanding of these Scriptural facts that leave always made the true worshippers of God to be zealous and steadfast in their faith not- withstanding the threats of death by the wicked. They know that even if they are killed because of their conviction God will raise them from the dead to glory in due course. So, too, a wicked man who escapes punishment in this life will come again to face the consequences of his actions.
    While some at the resurrection, will be rewarded abundantly with everlasting blessings, others will be punished and covered with shame. Concerning this Daniel, under the
    
    inspiration of the Al- mighty God, prophesied: "And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt."-Dan. 12: 2.
    First Resurrection
    The order and classification of resurrection are shown in the Scriptures. St. Paul stated: "But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; after-ward they that are Christ's at his coming." (I Cor. 15: 23)
    There is the first resurrection which is that of Jesus Christ and the Saints who the Anointed Christians are numbering 144,000. Among the disciples of Jesus the anointed ones are the first class. They constitute the "Little Flock" of which the twelve apostles were foundation members. (Luke 12: 32; Jas. 1: 18) They die in the flesh but they are raised as spirits like Jesus to dwell in heaven-the New Heaven-and reign with Christ in his glorious Kingdom.-I Pet. 3: 18; 2 Car. 5: 1-4.
    When St. Paul stated, "It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body" (I Car. 15: 44) he was referring to the death and resurrection of those of the "Little Flock" of which he is one. And he added; "And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly. Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption."- I Car. 15: 49, 50.
    The Scriptures show vividly that it -is at the second presence of Jesus Christ in the last days that the first resurrection would take place. (John 14: 1-3; I Cor. 15: 44-57; 2 Tim. 4: 6-8; Phil. 3: 20; 1 Them. 4: 16; Rev. 20: 4-6, etc.) This is already fulfilling but being events of a spiritual nature -many people including religious leaders and theologians do not know.
    Better Resurrection
    
    The faithful men and women of old before Christ will have their part in what St. Paul described as a "better resurrection". (Heb. 11: 4-40) They will all be raised from the dead to dwell on this earth, not in heaven, to receive their reward. Concerning them, St. Paul wrote: "Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, ,out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to fight the armies of the aliens. Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection." -Heb. 11: 33-35.
    What a wonderful, glorious and happy occasion it will be when those great just men and women will come back from "the land of the enemy" and team up with the faithful Christians on earth! But with the enemies of truth and righteousness, shame, wailing and torment will be their portion. Jesus Christ, knowing this, spoke of how there would be weeping and gnashing of teeth when those who falsely claim God's Kingdom would be driven out of it while the true Christians from all comers of the earth would be in it with Abraham and other ancient worthies who shall have then been resurrected.-Matt. 8: 11, 12; Luke 13: 28, 29.
    General Resurrection
    Finally, there will be a general resurrection during which all the remaining good people as well as bad ones will find their feet on earth again. The good will be rewarded with everlasting life in perfect peace and happiness in paradise on earth while the bad ones will be judged and punished according to their sins, Concerning this Jesus said: "Wonder not at this; for the hour is coming in the all that are in the grave shall hear the voice of the Son of God. And they that have done good things shall come forth onto the resurrection of life; but they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment."-John 5: 28, 29, (Douay Version)
    What is more, St. Paul confessed his faith about resurrection before Felix and said among other things: "But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets: And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust."- Acts 24: 14, 15.
    Great Comfort
    It is because of this glorious hope of the resurrection of the dead, which is a great comfort to those having its understanding, true Christians do not mourn for the dead like the pagans who have no hope. To this end Paul the apostle, gave this exhortation: "But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. Wherefore comfort one another with these words."-l Thess. 4: 13, 14, 18.`,
