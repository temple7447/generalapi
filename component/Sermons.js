         content:`THE salvation of God that would come to all repentant sinners through  Jesus Christ as of grace was, since the days of Moses the prophet, typified by a very significant incident when a serpent of brass was set up for the Israelites.
         The children of Israel were a stubborn people. Because of their faithlessness, in spite of the wonders of the Almighty God they saw in Egypt, they continued to sin. On several occasions while they were journeying to Canaan they provoked God by reason of their abominable deeds, and they were justly punished. But when they repented and turned to God they received mercy.
         One of such occasions was after the death of Aaron when they journeyed from Mount Hor by way of the Red Sea to the land of Edom. And because they grew impatient over the route they began to open their mouths wide I against Heaven. As a result of this God sent dreadful serpents to assail the camp of Israel and I many people were bitten to death.
         Here is the Bible record:
         “And they (the Israelites) journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red Sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way. And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, neither is there any  water; and our soul loatheth this light bread. And the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.”- Numbers 21: 4-6.
         Following this plague the Israelites came to their senses and realised their faults. They went to Moses their leader to confess that they had sinned for speaking against God and against him (Moses). They pleaded with him to pray to the Most High to take away the- serpents from them.
         Moses who was well known for his godly disposition and kind-heartedness and humility, acceded to their request and he interceded on their behalf.
         God heard the prayer of Moses. It was really an easy thing for Him to remove the venomous snakes all at once but He did not. Rather, He commanded Moses, saying, “Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.” – Numbers 21: 8.
         In obedience to the Lord’s instruction, Moses made a serpent of brass and erected it on a pole, “and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.”- Numbers 21: 9.
         
         
         
         All diligent students of the Bible do agree that the whole event which culminated in the erection of the brazen serpent was of great spiritual significance. There is quite a lot to learn from the experience of the Israelites and what God did to relieve them of their pains and to save them from death. Yes, it was Saint Paul who stated: “For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.” – Romans 15: 4.
         Now, let us ask ourselves this question: why was Israel plagued with fiery serpents by the very God of their fathers who had done so much to aid them at the time of their distress and adversity? It is clear from the Bible account that it was because they sinned against God. They were guilty of blasphemy – a very serious offence!
         Today there are people who behave like the faithless Israelites. For every misfortune that befalls them they blame the cause on God.
         When they find themselves in any unfavourable situation they turn round to accuse God-notwithstanding the fact that such a situation is of their own making. There is also the class of those, especially among the intellectuals of the world, who take pride in talking glibly and irreverently about God.
         Men must learn to know that God is not the one responsible for their ills or troubles. The evils or tribulations that often come upon us are either due to our own sins of the devil, taking advantage of our “infirmities being human and especially because of our sensualism, brings them upon us.
         The temptation of Job is a striking example of how the devil can trouble even the man of God with the aim of making the person to curse God and so fallout of His favour. Under such circumstances, the true worshippers of God are required to maintain their integrity in faith as Job himself did, and then cry to God in prayer for help and deliverance. – Job 2: 3; 27: 4, 6; Proverbs 11: 3; James 5: 10,11.
         Salvation
         Speaking in the first person through Isaiah the prophet, God declared: “Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else.” – Isaiah 45: 22.
         In order to fulfil His purpose of saving His people, God had to send His beloved Son, Jesus Christ, to the world not only to serve as a propitiation for the sins of mankind but also to be the Mediator through whom eternal life would be obtained in His glorious Kingdom. – 1 Timothy 2: 4-6; 1 John 2: 1, 2.
         Thus the brazen serpent, which God caused Moses to set up for snake-bitten Jews to look to and which served as a remedy for the plague of poisonous serpents, fore- shadowed Jesus Christ who would in due time be sent to the world  God for all mankind to look to for the healing of their  wounds and for their salvation.
         With this understanding at the back of his mind in regard to his mission on earth, Jesus Christ told Nicodemus concerning himself:
         “And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.”- John 3: 14, 15.
         Jesus Christ further explained the reason why the Heavenly Father has made such a grand arrangement for the benefit of sinful mankind when he said: “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” – John 3: 16.
         We must guard ourselves, by the grace of God, against sin. If the Israelites had not sinned they would not have been plagued. Therefore, sin, which is the transgressing of God’s commandment, is a great danger. “For the wages of sin,” said Saint Paul, “is death: but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”- Romans 6: 23.
         
         Antitypical
         
         It could be recalled that when the brazen serpent was erected on a pole in the days of Moses, the rule was that anyone who was bitten by a serpent would live only on the condition that he looked at the serpent of brass.
         We do know that since the setting up of the brazen serpent was typical, the looking at it was also literal – that is, it was the use of ordinary sight by way of turning the eyes, in the direction of the serpent of brass, of course, with the belief .that by so doing they were carrying out God’s instruction or command. But the case of Jesus Christ being antitypical, we are not expected to see him with our human eyes because he is now invisible being a spirit personality who has been glorified in heaven.
         Then, how do we look to Jesus Christ as to draw a parallel between the typical and antitypical? Christ himself gave the answer when he said, “That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.” (John 3: 15) The key-word in this text is BELIEVETH. In other words what is required is belief or faith in Jesus Christ.
         As a matter of fact, Jesus Christ told Thomas one of his apostles: “Ye believe because you have seen me. Blessed be those who believe though they have never seen me.” (John 20: 29 – Moffatt) What is more, St. Paul stated: “For we walk by “faith, not by sight.” – 2 Corinthians 5: 7.
         So today, the benefits of Christ’s redemption and his salvation are obtainable]e only on the condition that we BELIEVE in him. “He that believeth on the Son (Jesus) hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life: but the wrath of God abideth on him.” John 3: 36.
         However, we must not deceive ourselves in thinking that our mere belief in Jesus Christ while we wallow in sins, indulging in sinful lusts of the eyes and flesh, or when we worship him loosely, will save us. IT WILL NOT. It is when we have IMPLICIT FAITH in and LOVE for him, which will make us keep his commandments unhesitatingly, accept his true doc- trines and abide in the Church organization which preaches his TRUTH unadulteratedly, that we are qualified to claim to have looked to or accepted Christ. – Matthew 7: 21; Luke 6: 46-49; John 14: 15, 21-25; 8: 31-32, 36.
         
         Exalted Jesus
         
         The position of Jesus Christ among the creation of God is unique-it is a position of honour, glory and pre-eminence. We must therefore accept him as our Saviour and exercise implicit faith in him as such.
         Peter the apostle, addressing the council of the Jews, spoke of the greatness of Jesus Christ when he quoted the Hebrew Scriptures which today is called the Old Testament, to wit: “This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.” And he added: “Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.”- Acts 4: 10-12.
         Concerning the exaltation of Jesus Christ, St. Paul also wrote: “Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him (Jesus), and given him a name which is above every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.”- Philippians 2: 9-11.
         Furthermore, St. Paul gave an exhortation to the Hebrew Christians, which, in fact, is directed to every true disciple of Jesus Christ throughout the Christian era. He warned that in running the race of life, we as Christians must put away sin and divest ourselves of the burdens of the world that would impede our spiritual progress. He then admonished, “And let us run with patience the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.”– Hebrews 12: 1,2.
         In the light of the Scripture texts clearly explained in this sermon, we are not left in doubt that our salvation is in our hands. Therefore, “work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.” – Philippians 2: 12.`,

         content:`CHRISTIANITY is so fundamentally based and entrenched on established principles and doctrines that it cannot be blended or mixed with other beliefs without falling into the danger of corruption. This is what many people do not know.
    
         Interfaith is a mixture of beliefs – that is, people of different faiths coming together in a sort of union to worship.
         Ecumenism
         Today the wind of ecumenism is blowing all over Christendom. There is a strong desire by many church denominations to unite with others notwithstanding their differences in doctrines and forms of worship. For this reason certain churches have relaxed their rules which hitherto strictly forbade their adherents from having any form of communion with others.
         In pursuance of this same objective for church unity, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. Geoffrey Fisher, and his successor, Archbishop Michael Ramsey, had paid visits to both the late Pope John XXIII and Pope Paul VI, respectively, at the Vatican City. As a result of the meeting between Pope Paul and Archbishop Ramsey, 10 Roman Catholic and 11 Anglican theologians met together at Gazzada in Northern Italy, in January, 1967. They made recommendations for joint action on practical ways of removing tension between members of the two churches. A communiqué was issued after the talks which were described as the “first formal steps towards unity between the two churches in more than 400 years”. And the hopes of many people were raised!
         But three days after the talks, Pope Paul stated that Christian unity “still presents grave difficulties, for concept of real unity is not clear to all people.” He was speaking at his weekly blessing of pilgrims in St. Peter’s Square at the Vatican City. He said, “Some people consider that charity – which is certainly necessary – is enough for this unity without adhering to the unique truth of the faith.” (Daily Times, January 17, 1967)
         Catholic Idea
         Obviously, the Roman Catholic idea of church unity is quite different from what others are thinking. While some are reckoning it on terms of equal partners, the other is hoping that it is the coming back of the “separated brethren” to the one fold of the “Mother Church”.
         A Roman Catholic newspaper, the INDEPENDENT, issue of June 25-29, 1968, published at Ibadan, Western State of Nigeria, presented the Roman Catholic view on ecumenism as follows: “The word ECUMENISM is, it must be admitted, a rather difficult term for the ordinary Catholic to fully grasp or understand But we must be clear, first of all, as to what Ecumenism does not mean. It does not mean Eucharistic unity (i.e. we cannot regard the Holy Mass and a non-Catholic Communion Service as equal and interchangeable)..,..It does not mean a whittling down of Catholic doctrines to achieve a common faith with non-Catholics, for that would mean unfaithfulness to the Catholic Church as the ‘pillar and ground of Truth’,” (Italics ours).
         
         In answer to a question, the INDEPENDENT (June 20-27, 1964, page 5) stated: “Catholics ought not to attend non-Catholic religious functions. If they are present at public functions when non-Catholic prayers are said they ought not to answer ‘Amen’.”
         There is every reason to regard all the noise about the unification of all the churches as a show of spiritual ignorance on the part of some and sheer hypocrisy on the side of others. We do not see how a genuine unity can evolve from the attempts being made when nothing is being done to remove the root of bitterness and the cause of the division among them.
         In Amos 3: 3, it is written: “Can two walk together, except they be agreed?” Certainly, they cannot. It is a known fact that great differences in doctrines, church organisation and worship, exist among the churches. These have always been the main cause of controversy. Any union formed by the churches, therefore, with eyes closed upon these facts, is a union of contraries – and it is unchristian.
         Anglican Reply
         The Anglican Communion knows that the Roman Catholic Church does not regard it as an institution founded by God. The proof of this is evident from an Anglican reply to Roman Catholic arguments published in a booklet, the INFALLIBLE FALLACIES. The Anglican priests stated that some people of their parishes were being disturbed by the fact that the Roman Catholics regard them as non- Christians yet to be proselytised or converted and also by the repetition of untruths about their church. They added: “These untruths are part of the Roman Catholic campaign of trying to gain Anglicans for their own Church. Some of the most frequent of them are that ‘Henry VIII founded the Church of England’; that ‘Anglican bishops and priests are not real bishop!; and priests’ and that therefore ‘the sacraments administered in Anglican Churches are invalid!…We do not unchurch them, but they unchurch us. We regard the Pope as the lawful Bishop of Rome and their bishops and priests as properly consecrated and ordained, and their sacraments as valid. But they regard our bishops and priests as either deluded or deliberate impostors, and our sacraments as but imitations or mockeries of the divinely appointed channels of grace.” (Page 4, emphasis ours).
         No serious effort is known to have been made by the Anglican Communion to resolve or clear these GRAVE SPIRITUAL ISSUES before the efforts they are making WITHOUT REGARD FOR THE BIBLE – THE LAW AND GUIDE BOOK OF GOD – to get united with the Roman Catholic Church!
         Importance of Doctrines
         Another evidence of how strongly some people feel about the importance of doctrines in the worship of God was manifested when the Bishop of Rome declared the “bodily assumption of Mary” as an article of faith in 1950. It was reported that “nine British protestants wrote to Pope Pius XII offering to become Roman Catholics if he could produce a scriptural proof of the bodily assumption of the Virgin Mary.” (West African Pilot, October 30, 1950)
         
         So too, when the Swedish Church proposed to ordain women priests, the Church of England protested because it was considered to be scripturally wrong to do so. The then Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. Fisher, sent a “personal and confidential” letter to the Archbishop of Sweden warning that “if Sweden ordains women priests, relations between the two churches will be broken off”. (Daily Sketch, January 15, 1959, published in England.)
         Yes, Dr. Fisher was right, for God has never ordained women to be priests. Even in the church women are commanded not to speak, or teach but “to be under obedience”. – 1 Corinthians 14: 34, 35; 1 Timothy 2: 11-14.
         The point is that all these go to emphasise the awareness of some of the churches about the importance of the doctrines on which the Christian Faith is based. And that was why an Anglican Chaplain, Rev. R. Earnshaw-Smith said that “unification of Protestant Church with the Roman Catholic Church ‘is impossible’, because there existed a number of fundamental doctrinal differences between the Anglican Church and the Roman Catholic Church’ . He added, “There are such things as truth and error.” (Nigerian Daily Express, May 16, 1962.)
         “Credo”
         Only of recent Pope Paul re-affirmed in his “Credo” the belief of the Roman Catholic Church in certain doctrines which have always been the bone of contention between them and others. The Pope stated: “We believe in the infallibility enjoyed by the successor of Peter…We believe that Mary is the mother, who remained ever a virgin…preserved from all the stain of original sin and filled with gift of grace more than all other creatures. We believe that the mysterious presence of the Lord (in the Eucharist) is a true, real and substantial presence…the bread and wine have ceased to exist after the consecration so that it is the adorable body and blood of the Lord Jesus.” (INDEPENDENT, July 21-27, 1968).
         Now there are several church groups that do not believe in the bodily assumption of Mary, her being a virgin forever or the “Mother of God”; they do not believe in purgatory, the celibacy of priests, man-made saints, baptism of infants, the bodily presence of Christ in the bread and wine, or hell being a place of literal fire, and so on. But the Roman Catholic Church believes in all these and some others also believe in some of them.
         The obvious fact is that all cannot be right while they are opposed to one another. So if the claims of the Roman Catholics are true in the sense that they are founded on the authority of the Holy Bible, which all accept as the Guide Book, then others who disagree with them are false, and vice versa. And if some are true and others false, then there is no basis whatsoever for real unity.
         Baptists’ Stand
         The stand of the Baptists is already known. Dr. William R. Tolbert, Jr., President of the Baptist World Alliance and Vice- President of the Republic of Liberia, stated: “Baptists are opposed to any church unity movement which would destroy their basic beliefs.” He added that Baptists “would not associate with any movement to set up a hierarchy to control and influence individual churches.” (African Challenge, No. 196, page 5).
         Here in Nigeria, efforts are also being made towards a “United Church of Nigeria”. The GKS is not a party to it PURELY on doctrinal and other scriptural grounds. And some church leaders of the orthodox groups have asked that their churches should be counted out too. It could be observed that all the obstacles undermining these efforts very well spring from the same variances in doctrines and methods of worship.
         In the October issue of the Spear magazine in 1965. The views of some of the religious leaders were published. Arch- bishop John Aggey of the Roman Catholic Church in Lagos said: “There will be more confusion if the Roman Catholic Church joins the union now because we have certain beliefs different from those of other sects. ”
         In the same issue of the Spear, Colonel John, the head of the Salvation Army in Nigeria, was quoted as saying, “We wish those who are planning to form the Union success. H they think that is the best thing for their churches, God bless them. The Salvation Army is not thinking about joining the Union at this stage because our constitution is different from those of other churches. For example, we have women as Ministers in our church while others don’t…”
         Now the Roman Catholic Church is not prepared to whittle down its doctrines and the Protestant groups also cannot buldge in their beliefs. So any union of all these in the face of the vast differences is but a marriage of convenience to please the world.
         Bible Standard
         There is danger in interfaith because it is an evidence of apostasy or departure from the Way of Life on the part of the true worshippers of God. The Bible standard is that the true Christian Faith must not be violated or compromised.
         Any church group that does not preach the truth faithfully as contained in the Bible is false. ” He that hath my word, let him speak my word FAITHFULLY”, said God, “What is the chaff to the wheat?” – Jeremiah 23: 28.
         Concerning this atomic space age, St. Paul stated: “Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; speaking lies in hypocrisy;…forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats…” – l Timothy 4: 1-3.
         For true Christians to pray together with people of various and wrong beliefs or have fellowship with those preaching the doctrines of devils is INTERFAITH; it is spiritual fornication; it is a sin. – l Corinthians 10: 21. 22; Matthew 6: 24; James 4: 4.
         No Compromise
         Jesus Christ whose example Christians are bound to follow (John 13: 15) did not compromise his faith with those of the Pharisees and other false religionists of his time. , Rather he exposed and condemned their errors and hypocrisy. He said: “… Woe unto  you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men’s bones, and of all uncleanness. Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity…” – Matthew 23: 23-31.
         Today, there are the counterparts of the Pharisees whose stock-in-trade is deceit: and hypocrisy – sometimes coined in a refined term as “religious diplomacy”.
         When the devil was to show up himself where Christ was doing the work of God, he (Jesus) told his disciples: “…For the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me …Arise, let us go hence.” – John 14: 30, 31. Christ did NOT COMPROMISE!
         What is more, St. Paul stated: “DO: NOT UNITE yourselves with unbelievers; they are not fit mates for you. What has righteousness to do with wickedness? Can light consort with darkness? Can Christ agree with Belial, or a believer join hands with an unbeliever?. And therefore, ‘come away and leave them, separate yourselves, says the Lord; do not touch what is unclean (and lie is unclean being an abomination – Proverbs 6: 16-19) Then I will accept you, says the Lord, the Ruler of all being…” – 2 Corinthians 6: 14-18, New English Bible.
         It is on this Christian principle the God’s Kingdom Society stands. Certainly, there is no agreement between light and darkness. Truth and falsehood can never harmonize. So we uphold the banner of truth at all times, and, like Saint Paul, “renounce the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God.” – 2 Corinthians 4: 1, 2
         God from time has been against interfaith and has never tolerated it. The Jews who practised it were severely punished. The instance of Solomon is always remembered by serious worshippers of God. “Did not Solomon King of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did outlandish (unbelieving, strange) women cause to sin.”- Nehemiah 13: 26; 1 Kings 11: 1-14.
         For the details of how the Jews practised interfaith and how they were punished, read Psalm 106: 13-46.
         Peaceful Co-existence
         The GKS, though strongly opposed to interfaith, believes in tolerance and in peaceful co-existence with other religious groups until God’s day of decision when the tares will be destroyed by Him.-Rom. 12:17-21; Matthew 13: 1-9, 36-43.
         
         INTERFAITH IS DANGEROUS. Beware lest you fall a victim and end up in destruction from God. One becomes a victim when one believes in “the doctrines of devils” and unite oneself with those “who are not fit mates” Yes, God says “come away and leave them, separate yourselves”.`,
          title:"THE DANGER OF INTERFAITH"},
     {key:3,
         content:`IT is a vital requirement of the Christian Faith that whoever will be saved must have the accurate knowledge of the truth. This is the will of God. (1 Timothy 2: 3, 4) The claim by anybody that he believes in Jesus Christ and accepts him as his personal Saviour is not enough for salvation unless his belief is grounded on the truth.
         The word truth in the English language means that which conforms to fact and reality, or that which is not false or fictitious. So in this respect one can say the truth of a thing that happens either in the market or elsewhere, or the truth of what one has done, and so on.
         But in the context of the subject of this sermon, the meaning is spiritual and it bears a connotation that is much wider than the ordinary usage.
         In John 1: 17, it is written: “For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.” The inquiring mind would want to know what this truth is.
         When Jesus Christ was addressing the believing Jews during his first advent, he said: “If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.” – John 8: 31, 32.
         That was not all. At the time he was arraigned before Pilate, the Roman governor, he again made reference to the truth. Said he, “My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered, to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.”.. Pilate was rather curious about the claim of it Jesus Christ of having a kingdom, and so he asked: “Art thou a king then?” Instantly, Jesus answered: “Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice”. It was at this juncture Pilate further asked, “What is truth?” – Read John 18: 36-38.
         Whatever was the motive of Pilate in asking the question, it, is all the more interesting to note that it has turned to good in that the very question has been taken up with all sincerity by faithful Christian students of the Bible as a subject for diligent research into the spiritual import of the TRUTH.
         Long before the human existence of Jesus Christ on this earth, it had been prophetically written in the Psalms that “truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven”. – Psalm 85: 11.
         Word of God
         In a nutshell, the TRUTH, for which Jesus Christ came to this world to bear witness, is the WORD OF GOD otherwise known as the “everlasting gospel” or the “gospel of peace”. – Romans 10: 15; Ephesians 6: 15; Revelation 14: 6, 7.
         The Psalmist said that the law of God is the truth and that His word is true from the beginning. (Psalm 119: 142, 151, 160) Jesus himself confirmed that the word of God is the truth. In his prayer to the Heavenly Father on behalf of his disciples, he said: “Sanctify them through thy truth: THY WORD IS TRUTH…And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through thy truth.” – John 17: 17-19.
         It is abundantly clear that without the knowledge of the truth no one can practise the righteousness of God or obtain salvation. It is the truth that purifies as to make. One holy; the truth instils the fear of God in the believer; it gives faith; and it gives sound wisdom and understanding that enables one to distinguish between holy and unholy, or right and wrong.
         The fact that God’s word, the truth, cleanses one from sin was further strengthened by Jesus Christ when he said to his disciples: “Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.” (John 15: 3) And St. Paul described the word of God as water when he wrote- as to how Jesus Christ gave himself, up for the church “that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word”. (Ephesians 5: 26) This is not the literal water used for baptism as some people think but the word of God, the truth.
         Because the truth warns against sin and enjoins people to follow righteousness, anyone who believes in it and translates his belief into action will of necessity put away evil and do that which is good. It is in this way the truth sanctifies or cleanses one. That is the reason why it is written in Psalm 119: 9, to wit: “Wherewithal shall, a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to Thy (God’s) word.” And the Psalmist added: “Thy word have I hid in my heart, that I might not sin against Thee.” (Verse11).
         It is because people disregard the truth and do not pay heed to the word of God that they continue to perpetrate wicked acts. They take pleasure in sin. When they do evil they have no prick of conscience because they are destitute of the truth and consequently, the fear of God which it instils in one and which makes one eschew evil, is not in them.
         Pure Wisdom
         The wisdom which the truth imparts is far superior to any form of worldly knowledge. It is the wisdom from above which James the apostle described as “pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy”. Yes, this wisdom found only in the Bible leads one to salvation. – James. 3: 17; 2 Timothy 3: 14, 15.
         The truth is so forceful that it is able to change the whole character of a man from evil inclinations to godly thoughts and deeds. King David stated: “The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple. The statutes of the Lord are right. rejoicing the heart: the command of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes…More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honey comb. Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward.” Psalm 19: 7-11.
         St. Paul who himself also derived great benefits from his knowledge of the truth, stated: “For the word of God is quick (alive)! and powerful, and sharper than any two edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.” – Hebrews 4: 12.
         It is all these wonderful, divine characteristics of the word of God that makes the Holy Bible, which contains it, the greatest book ever in existence in this world.
         All through history men of high reputation whose sense of spiritual value was not beclouded by devilish philosophies or evil propensities, had always acknowledged the truth of God’s word, its goodness and irresistible force.
         Concerning the Holy Bible, which contains the word of God, Abraham Lincoln had this to say: “In regard to this great book, I have but to say, it is the best gift God has given to men. All the good Saviour gave to the world was communicated through this book. But for it we could not know right from wrong. All things most desirable for man’s welfare, here and hereafter, are to be found portrayed in it.”
         And J. Edgar Hoover, a distinguished U. S. lawyer, said: “The Bible is the unfailing guide which points the way for men to the perfect life. The lessons of charity, justice, and equality which enrich its pages should be learned well by all men in order that greed, avarice, and iniquity can be blotted out.”
         The truth comprises doctrines, judgments, instructions and divine promises. The doctrines are the basis of Christian beliefs; judgments are for the discipline of the believers; the instructions are for the guidance of the Christians in following the path of life; and the promises give hope and comfort to the faithful.
         The Psalmist described the word of God as a lamp to his feet, and a light to his path. (Psalm 119: 105) And King Solomon whose wisdom, as given him by God, was remarkable, stated: “For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life.”- Proverbs 6: 23.
         For the fact that Jesus Christ is the very embodiment of the word of God, and therefore the light-bearer, he declared: “I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.” (John 8: 12) Again, he said: “I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.” – John 14: 6.
         Power of God
         The importance of the truth, which is the gospel of Christ, cannot be over emphasised. St. Paul stated that “it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth…For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith”. – Romans 1: 16, 17.
         To be ignorant of the truth, is to be under spiritual bondage. People in such a state can never know unless the scales of the blindness fall off their eyes, they even claim to be in the light but oppose the truth. The case of Saul, who became an apostle and was known as Paul, is a striking example. When he was professing Judaism-the Jewish religion-be persecuted the Christians but when he was converted and came to the knowledge of the truth, be confessed his ignorance. Said he of himself: “Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.” – 1 Timothy 1: 13.
         Some people take offence when they are told the truth; such ones need prayer so that the devil may leave them. Those who WILFULLY oppose the truth, and persecute those preaching or spreading it are wicked, and God shall destroy them. Jesus Christ told such ones in his days: “And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not. He that is of God heareth God’s words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.” – John 8: 43-47. And St. John said: “He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life: but the wrath of God abideth on him.” – John 3: 36. See also Luke 10: 1,2,8-12, 16; Mark 9: 42.
         Saving Gospel
         It is for the purpose of enlightening the lost sheep of God and giving them freedom from the bondage of Satan in order that they may be saved that Jesus Christ came to preach his saving gospel of truth. Concerning his mission Christ referred to Isaiah’s prophecy which fulfilled on him, to wit: “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised…” – Luke 4: 17-21; see also 2 Timothy 2: 24-26.
         And up till today, the gospel is being preached by those who know the truth in accordance with the command of Jesus Christ. – Matthew 24: 14; 28: 19.
         The truth is very precious. It must not be adulterated by way of adding lie to it and mixing it with vain traditions of men.
         The Bible says “no lie is of the truth”. (1 John 2: 21). Anyone who believes in a lie is damned. Saint Paul made it clear that those who will perish would become victims of Satan’s deceit “because they receive not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: that they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.” – 2 Thessalonians 2: 10-12.
         Today, in our age, some people and/or churches teach traditions of men instead of God’s doctrines in the Bible. It was because the Scribes and Pharisees acted contrary to the truth and followed men’s traditions that Jesus Christ told them: “… Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition. Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, this people draweth nigh unto me (God) with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. – Matthew 15: 1-9.
         It is very important, therefore, that we look well before accepting and believing any teaching or doctrine from anybody no matter his religious claims, or social status, or scholastic achievement. We must be sure that anything we believe has the backing of the Scriptures, as the early Christians of Berea did, otherwise we believe or worship in vain. – Acts 17: 10- 12; see also Galatians 1: 8, 9.
         St. Paul admonished Timothy and said: “Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine: continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thy self, and them that hear thee.”- 1 Timothy 4: 16.
         
         Let us therefore cleave to the truth which is able to make us free from the bondage of Satan, deceits of false prophets, idolatrous commitments, superstitions and all other devices of the devil, so as to be saved by God through Jesus Christ our Lord into His perfect Kingdom of endless peace and happiness.`,
         title:"WHAT IS TRUTH?"},
     {key:4, 
        content:`THAT it is virtually impossible to preach the truth of the gospel of Christ without condemning evil or exposing falsehood is an indisputable fact. Any preaching, therefore, that does not come in conflict with the works of error is not the gospel of Jesus Christ.
        In any issue on which opinions of men differ from one another the reasonable thing to do in order to resolve it is to resort to an authority upon which all can safely rely. If it is a matter in a court of justice and a point of law is involved, a legal authority must be found in order to decide as to which of the divergent views is right. So too if it is a matter about the Christian faith, doctrine or principle, we must depend on the Holy Bible for a solution.
        The mistake many people make is that they are too prone to rush into conclusions on spiritual matters about which personal opinions are of no consequence. They do not care to ascertain as to whether the view they hold is in accord with the Word of God. It was King Solomon who said: “Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths. Be not wise in thine own eyes…” – Proverbs 3:5-7.
        The question as to whether Christians can judge or criticise one another is one of those issues about which people hold different views. Only last week, a friend told a member of the God’s Kingdom Society: “I like the GKS because they are preaching the truth. But they should preach their own without criticising other churches.” That apart, a certain clergyman, having received a copy of The Weekly Sermon, said a similar thing about the GKS but added: “The Bible says, judge not.”
        On this question of criticism or judgment, there is no support in the Scriptures for the view that Christians should not judge or criticise one another. Rather there is abundance of evidence to the contrary.
        The Text
        The text often referred to by our critics is Matthew chapter 7, verse 1, where it is written: “Judge not, that ye be not judged.”
        We agree that Jesus Christ made this statement. But the interpretation some people give to it is very wrong and misleading. Christ himself gave its interpretation in verses 2, 3, 4 and 5, but many people have not the patience to read these verses, let alone understand them. He did not mean that we should not judge or criticise at all. Rather, he meant that before we judge we should make sure that we are in a position to do so in the sense that we ourselves are free from the fault for which we judge others. For if we too are guilty of what we criticise in others, they also will in return point accusing fingers at us.
        In verse 2, Jesus continued: “For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged; and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.” This will happen when the person who judges another is equally guilty in that as he criticises or treats others so too they will do to him, he being not free.
        And in verses 3 and 4, Jesus- Christ threw more light on the point when he further said: “And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?”
        It is possible some may still be in doubt as regards the intention of Christ or misconstrue the whole illustration; so he reprimanded those who always see others’ faults and not theirs, and positively stated what Christians should do, as it is written: “Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother’s eye”
        According to the whole tenor of his illustration there is no justification whatsoever for the conclusion that Christ is against criticism. Contrariwise, it is clear that we can judge others of their errors provided we correct ourselves and put away our own. By this standard a thief is not qualified to criticize another person who steals, and an adulterer is not in a position to judge another person who commits fornication when he himself has not fully repented otherwise he will be regarded as a hypocrite.
        In support of this principle as established by Jesus Christ, St. Paul stated that whoever condemns sin in others and do the very same thing has no defence at all but condemns himself. He declares: “Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judges; for wherein thou judgest another, thou consdemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things” – Romans 2:1.
        Character of Jesus
        When a thing is wrong Christians should have the boldness to say it is wrong; and when they see the truth let them say it and stand by it. This was the character of Jesus Christ when he was on earth.  He criticized the Pharisees and Sadducees for their false claims and exposed their evil practices. When he crossed swords with the Sadducees on the question of resurrection, he told them bluntly: “Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.” – Matthew 22:29.
        On a certain occasion when Jesus censured the Pharisees and they took offence, his disciples asked him: “Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?” Christ answered at once: “Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up, Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.” – Matthew 15:12-14.
        It is because people fear to say the truth or to condemn what they know to be evil that the world is sinking more and more in iniquity. Many religious leaders who claim to be vicars, apostles, bishops, chief imams, and so forth connive at the evil doings of their followers, particularly the nobles among them, because of their tendencies of seeking to please men rather than being faithful to God.
        The tribulation in Nigeria today has been blamed on the excesses of politicians during the civilian regime. But when, among the politicians and others, there were glaring cases of oppression, bribery and corruption, adultery, mischief-making. deliberate falsehood, drunkenness and so on, what did their spiritual leaders do to rebuke their sins or evil deeds and warn them against the danger they were exposing the nation to, and God’s judgment and punishment that could eventually follow? And since trouble erupted it is these same religious leaders who adopted an attitude of dumbness over sin that are now most vocal, in their” usual act of sanctimoniousness, in a frantic bid for prayers. Can God hear our prayers when we have not repented of our sins and are not sober? “Behold, the Lord’s hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot bear; but your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you that he will not hear…” – Isaiah 59: 14.
        However, we trust that the good Lord will for His name’s sake spare this Republic so that His innocent children may have a free course to serve Him in love.
        The stand of the GKS for the truth and righteousness of God is admired by many people, but some envy and oppose her. However, the truth always prevails.
        It was interesting to note, as reported in the New Nigerian of August 24, 1966, that the Anglican Archbishop C. J. Patterson “blamed religious leaders for their studied silence” over the situation in Nigeria. He was further quoted as saying in a circular letter to his fold: “We are the devil by the weakness of our divisions which prevent us from speaking unanimously.”
        We appreciate the Archbishop’s courage for accepting blame but the excuse for their weakness is untenable. The divisions among Christians is no justifiable around for any servant of Christ to refrain from discharging his spiritual functions creditably; Unanimity of speaking is not all that is important but rectitude, forth rightness and truth notwithstanding the voice of dissent.
        Teachings
        We do not condemn personalities or individuals. We do not say that all those in other religious groups are devils, and those in the GKS are holy. What we criticize are the teachings and doings which we have found to be unscriptural and therefore erroneous.
        For instance, some teach and make people believe in purgatory whereas Jesus Christ and his early apostles did not teach any such thing. Purgatory is not found anywhere in the Bible. There are those who teach that the soul can never die; but the Bible shows clearly that the soul can die. – Psalm 89: 48; Ezekiel 18: 4; Matthew 10: 28; Acts 3; 23, etc. Others also command their priests not to marry but the Bible says that “a bishop must be the husband of one wife”. (1 Timothy 3:1,2) Certain church groups baptise infants without scriptural authority. There are a lot more that are taught and done falsely in the name of God.
        A teacher of lies is a great danger to human societies because they lead people at the instance of the devil to destruction. (Isaiah 9:16; Jeremiah 14:14; Matthew 15:14) To say that the lies of bogus preachers should not be pointed out or criticized is contrary to the will of God.  It is a duty incumbent on the true servants of Christ to warn people against false prophets. The encounter of St. Paul with Bar-Jesus, a false prophet, in his days is a case in point. St. Paul called him “the child of the devil” and “an enemy of righteousness” Addressing him St. Paul said: “Wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?” The apostle then cursed him in the name and power of the Lord and the false prophet became blind. And when Sergius Paulus, a ruler, saw all that happened, he believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord”  – Read Acts 13:6-13.
        If Christian must not judge one another, then those who say that the GKS is wrong for criticizing others are equally guilty for judging the GKS.
        However, the truth is that there is no church organization that does not judge others; otherwise there would have been no divisions among them. As reported in a Roman Catholic newspaper, the INDEPENDENT (Sept. 5-12, 1964, page 2) “Protestants of all kinds have strong doctrinal differences from Catholics and their orders are generally not recognized by the Catholic Church”.
        Church history is replete with incidents of atrocities committed against people because of their Christian convictions by those who purported to be the “pillar of truth” in Christendom. Why were people like John Wycliffe, John Huss, Martin Luther and a host of others branded as heretics and some of them condemned to the flames?
        Now, after hundreds of years, the Roman Catholic Church has come out to own its faults. In October 1964, the Vatican Council voted by an overwhelming majority that Roman Catholics should ask pardon from other Christians for their share in bringing about disunity. The text of a draft degree passed by the assembly by 2,076 votes to 92, called for “conversion of heart”. The text said: “All have responsibility in one way for the sins of disunity. Roman Catholics therefore ask for pardon of God and of their brethren…” Daily Times, October 8, 1964, page 7).
        The point we are making is that other religious bodies do judge and some overstepped their bounds to condemn souls to death.  But all the GKS is doing, and that with all sincerity, is that of showing the light so that the people may find the way to Christ. We will never go to the extreme of condemning people to death. God says, “Vengeance is mine” – Romans 12:19.
        Written Judgement
        The preaching of the gospel involves the pronouncing of the written judgements of God in the Bible in condemnation of all that answer to unrighteousness. Jesus said that the words he had spoken would judge men in the last day. – John 12:48.
        How can the words spoken by Christ nearly 2,000 years ago judge men in this last day? Yes, it is through the propagation of the gospel by those he has commissioned through the anointing of the Holy Spirit. Indeed, to pronounce the written judgement of God is the honour of the saints in particular, and it is also the duty of the saints’ companions who are partakers of their grace to rebuke sin. – Psalm 149: 7-9; Romans 10:13-15; 1 John 2:27; 1 Corinthians 6:1-3; Jude 14, 15; 1 Timothy 5:20, 22; 2 Timothy 4:1, 2; Titus 1:4-9; etc.
        Whenever the written judgement is preached, being the truth, it brings to light every false way and has a piercing effect against all on the side of error. St. Paul stated: “But we are sure that the judgement of God is according to truth against them which commit such things.” – Romans 2:2, see also Hebrews 4:12.
        There is always a conflict between truth and falsehood. As light exposes what is hidden in darkness so too the truth uncovers or brings to view lies, hypocrisy and all other hidden things of dishonesty. St. Paul warned the Christians to “have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them”. He added: “But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.” – Ephesians 5:11-13.
        For obvious reasons, evil men and those whose teachings are questionable do not want criticism. They always oppose and persecute those preaching the truth. That was why St. Paul said that they preached “the gospel of God with much contention” – 1 Thessalonians 2:1-4.
        There are certain church leaders who warn their adherents not to listen to the lectures of the GKS, and some even dictate to their followers not to read publications of others. Such is an attitude of those whose doctrines are not true.
        It is those who have something to hide that fear to come to the light. Jesus said: “For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.” – John 3:20, 21.
        Any church organization that is preaching the truth will have no cause to fear judgement. The truth is quick and forceful, and it can withstand any acrid test of criticism, and triumph over everything that rises against it by the power of God. Milton, the English Puritan poet, was right when he stated, “Truth IS as ‘impossible to be soiled by any outward touch as the sunbeam”. Also an erstwhile judge of the Supreme Court of, the United States was once reported as saying, “If a religious belief has substance, it can survive criticism, heated and abusive though it may be, with the aid of truth and reason alone;” And Saint Paul in his characteristic straightforwardness wrote: “For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.” – 2 Corinthians 13: 8.
        Criticisms aimed at correcting errors and reproving evils are necessary for progress. “All Scripture is given by the Inspiration of God” said St. Paul, “and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for Correction, for instruction in righteousness: that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.” – 2 Timothy 3: 16, 17.
        The only thing is that our judgment must not be malicious or based on false premises put constructive and just. Said Jesus Christ: “Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.” – John 7: 24.
        On the whole, it has been established beyond all reasonable doubt that Christians can judge or criticise one another in accordance with the Holy Scriptures.
        
        May God bless those who understand and appreciate the truth of His word when told – whether in the form of correction, reproof or rebuke, criticism or judgment, advice or instruction. Amen.`,

        content:`ON the first Sunday of October every year the God’s Kingdom Society commemorates the birth of the Beloved Son of God Almighty, Jesus Christ the Righteous, as FREEDOM DAY. His birth in Bethlehem about 2,000 years ago marked a turning-point in the history of the human race.
    Freedom day is not an occasion for riotous merry-making but that for sober reflections on the goodness of God for sending Jesus Christ to this evil world for the spiritual emancipation of His lost sheep. It is an occasion for meditating on the significance of the mission of Christ on earth, and for self-examination as to whether we are living up to the expectation of the Lord.
    The celebration is always marked by divine services held in all branches of the GKS, and the President, Brother E. T. Otomewo, usually sends a written message that is read and explained during the services.
    The following is the full text of the Freedom Day Message of the President this year:-
    Members and Friends,
    HAIL JEHOVAH AND JESUS CHRIST!
    On this glorious occasion of the commemoration of the auspicious birth of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, the greatest Advocate of freedom who has ever lived on this earth, I send you all my hearty Christian greetings and wish you the Lord’s blessings and protection!
    As many of you know, we of the God’s Kingdom Society (GKS) hail the Almighty God whose name is Jehovah, and Jesus Christ, the Redeemer of mankind, because it is They only that can truly save as recorded in Psalm 3:8; Isaiah 45:21,22; John 17: 3; Acts 4:10-12; Revelation 7: 9-17.
    Through the frequent criticisms of the GKS and some others, many people are now aware of the fact that Jesus Christ was not born in December but in October. I do not intend to go into details now on this issue. But suffice it to say that there is no authentic history or Bible record which says that Jesus Christ was born on December 25. Even the Roman Catholic Church has agreed with the GKS at last on this matter. A Roman Catholic magazine, The Catholic Voice, had this to say in its issue of July 1962:
    “The Gospels do not mention any date for the birth of Christ. We do not know the date of Christ’s birth, not even the year in which He was born. We celebrate the feast of Christ’s birth, on the 25th of December at least in the Western Church. The Eastern Catholic Church celebrates the same feast on the 6th of January. These dates are not based on historical evidences of the exact date of Christ’s birth. The 25th of December was chosen to celebrate Christmas in the third century. . . “ (Page 110)
    We shall treat the subject about the date of Christ’s birth in due course and have it published in The Weekly Sermon.
    THE GOLDEN RULE
    The theme of my message for the Freedom Day this year, 1968, is drawn from the remarkable and famous statement of Jesus Christ at Luke chapter 6, verse 31, to wit: “And As Ye Would That Men Should Do To You, Do Ye Also To Them Likewise.” This has been described as the Golden Rule, which, if followed or observed by men, will certainly bring peace and harmony to the world and thus fulfil to the letter the blessing of “peace and good will” bestowed upon mankind when Jesus Christ was born in: Bethlehem. On that memorable occasion, the angels of heaven chanted in praise of God, saying:
    “…Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.” – Read Luke 2: 8-14.
    It is clear from what we see among men and in the so-called Christian nations and/or countries of the world that the majority of the people-even among those professing Christianity-do not know Jesus Christ. In other words, they neither understand the teachings of Christ nor his way of life. Indeed, Jesus himself said: “Not everyone that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.” – Matthew 7: 21.
    Christianity means more than oral declarations or mere attendance at services on Sundays. It must be practised in the sense of absolute submission to Jesus Christ, the only Mediator between God and men, and keeping his commandments.
    Jesus Christ preached the truth of God’s word faithfully, uncompromisingly and fearlessly. He was sincere, humble, kind, forthright and godly. He loved his sheep, and for their sake he laid down his life as a ransom. “Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends,” said he. (John 15: 14).
    Hypocrisy
    Christ hated hypocrisy and he warned his disciples: “…Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.” (Luke 12: 1) But today we find that hypocrisy has become the common habit of some people who claim to be Christ’s  representatives or followers.
    Where there is hypocrisy, the Golden Rule of “do ye also to them as ye would that they should do to you”, becomes meaningless. We have heard of some pastors or religious leaders who, after warning their flocks against adultery, go in the dark or in some secret corners to seduce and commit adultery with the wives of some of their followers. Some of these evil acts, as alleged, take place when the women go to the priests to make confessions, or to receive “holy” communion, or to ask for prayers.
    Naturally, any or the priests who indulges in such iniquitous acts, if married, Will not want his wife to be defiled by anyone; yet he has the devilish courage to do to people what he would not want others to do to him!
    You as a father will not want your daughter to be beaten up by her husband who is your son-in-law, as some often do, but you mercilessly flog your wife, another man’s daughter, in your home even for petty domestic misunderstandings! Do you, by so doing, observe the Golden Rule as laid down by Jesus Christ? Certainly not!
    Your son or daughter or brother or sister just from school with the School Certificate – perhaps with a first division pass – goes to a prospective employer or a personnel manager for employment. He or she passes the interview creditably and proves competent in every respect for the job but he or she would not be employed UNLESS your son or brother offers a bribe of £20, or your daughter or sister gives up herself to be carnally defiled. No doubt, you will not be pleased – and no godly person will ever be pleased – with such an incident. But this is exactly what some people do to others, yet they call themselves Christians!
    Guilty Conscience
    Moreover, you as an individual will be displeased if someone slanders or back-bites you, yet many Christians so-called slander their fellow Christians. The God’s Kingdom Society has often been made an object of deliberate misrepresentations, slander and reproaches by her detractors who also (profess to be Christians.
    The evils done by people are so many that one cannot enumerate all of them especially in an address such as this. Anyone who does what is bad knows in his conscience that he is doing evil; and the guilty conscience has a way of tormenting one. Indeed, John the apostle of Jesus Christ said: “For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things. Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God.”-1 John 3: 20, 21.
    Those who do to others what they do not want others to do to them are not fit to hold public offices, and if they claim to be Christians, they are of the type concerning who m Jesus Christ, quoting Isaiah the prophet, said: “This people draw nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.” – Matthew 15: 7, 8.
    Yes, all such ones – bogus Christians they are – are a reproach to Jesus Christ and except they repent of their evil deeds they shall lose all their ill-gotten gains and suffer destruction from God in the end, for giving cause for the ungodly to reproach God and His church.- Isaiah 3: 11; Romans 2: 24. 25; Galatians 6: 7. 8.
    As earlier stated in this message, God through His angels, blessed mankind with peace and goodwill when Jesus Christ was born. (Luke 2:14) But the fact that the whole world does not enjoy this peace and the nations are hardly of any genuine goodwill towards one another shows clearly that man has gone far away from the path of peace having, like as in the days of Noah before the flood, sunk deep into the ocean of sin. The fact of this is obvious as could be seen in the carnality and godlessness of men the world over.
    The speed at which our present generation is running after sin is rising so high that there is cause for fear that it will surpass the sins of Sodom and Gomorrah because of which those cities were utterly wasted. And God warned that the fate of the sinners in Sodom and Gomorrah should serve as an example to those who love sin. – 2 Peter 2: 4-10.
    Nevertheless, as God has never left Himself without a witness, there are men and women on earth today who serve Him in truth. They appreciate the fact that Jesus Christ died for their sins. This they know does not mean that they should continue to sin, but that they should deny “ungodliness and worldly lusts” and “Jive soberly, righteously, and godly, in this pre- sent world …” – Titus 2: 11-14.
    Charity
    Before I conclude, I will not fail to emphasize that the essence of the Golden Rule is bound up in one word – CHARITY. And charity is LOVE. This is the virtue without which no one can successfully translate the Golden Rule into action. The truth of this will be more appreciated if we lay to heart the statement of St. Paul that “he who loves his neighbour has satisfied every claim of the law”. He added: “For the commandments, ‘Thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not covet’, and any other commandment there may be, are all summed up in the one rule, ‘Love your neighbour as yourself.’ Love cannot wrong a neighbour; therefore the whole law is summed up in love.” -Romans 13: 8-10, New English Bible.
    Amplifying on the excellence of charity or love over all other gifts, the apostle, in his first letter to the Christians at Corinth, stated: “And though I bestow all my goods  to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing. Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh not evil; rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things…. An now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.” – 1 Corinthians chapter 13.
    Truly, if we do unto others what we want them to do to us, there will be “peace, good will” and harmony everywhere in the world.
    
    May God continue to preserve His sheep wherever they are so that they may live to worship Him in love and peace through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen`,

        content:`NO one who has a clear insight into God’s revelations as contained in the Holy Bible will ever doubt the reality of the existence of heaven. The truth of God remains unaffected though unconverted, misinformed and faithless men may doubt it.
    Conflicting views have been expressed by people about heaven. Some people believe and teach that it is a place where all good men, women and even children go after death to enjoy everlasting bliss.
    Religious racketeers have used their trumped up ideas of heaven to play on the ignorance of people, taking money from them with the promise and hope that whatever they spend for the church is being used in heaven to prepare a place for them. Sometimes fictitious stories of certain people carried in the arms of angels to heaven are told the flock from the pulpit with a view to making the sermons interesting as well as boosting up the economy of the church. For this same purpose the parable of Jesus Christ about Lazarus and the rich man has been given a twist and interpreted literally as if poverty is the passport to heaven. But priests are making themselves rich on earth!
    In a religious magazine, THE PRAIRIE OVERCOMER, issue of January 1953, published monthly by Prairie Bible Institute, Alberta, Canada, the story of a “woman who saw heaven” was reported. The woman, as reported, “died at three o’ clock” and “her family, in accordance with Chinese custom, had immediately prepared her body for burial”. At about sunset a noise was heard in the death chamber, the report went on, and the woman was found awake sitting erect and having removed her grave clothes and put on those she had been wearing before her death. She was then quoted as saying:
    “I remember seeing all the family around me crying. Then the Lord Jesus came into the room and took me by the hand and said, ‘Come with Me.’ In a short time we were before a gate of pearl. It was the gate of Heaven. Angels opened it and we went in. I saw many beautiful houses all of pretty colours…”
    The report says that “people flocked in from miles around to hear the wonderful story” and “they could not reject her testimony”
    We must point out that this story of the woman cannot be reconciled with the teachings of Jesus Christ whom she said took her by the hand and, therefore, the story is most unacceptable. A demon in a pretended appearance of Jesus Christ and others in the guise of angels might have appeared to her, and from her own account it is clear that she was, according to the Scriptures, a victim of evil spirits – demons. – 2 Corinthians 11: 14, 15; 1 John 4: 1; Revelation 16: 13, 14.
    Ignorance
    It is certain teachings of some of the churches which have neither the backing of the Scriptures nor of sound reason, that have turned some people to be agnostics and atheists believing not in God or heaven or other sacred truths. But some atheists and agnostics – the reasonable and humble ones – have become Christians after discussions, which were devoid of prejudice, with Christian leaders who preach the truth. However, we know, too, that some do not believe Christian doctrines because of their arrogance and spiritual ignorance (John 9: 39-41); and some others being devils incarnate never appreciate or understand the truth of God but always oppose it. – Psalm 10: 4, 5; Daniel 12: 10; 1 Corinthians 2: 14; 2 Corinthians 4: 3, 4.
    On the other hand, there are people who argue that heaven is not a place and that it cannot be located but that it is a state or condition. They hold the view that when a person is living well in comfort, and enjoying the good things of life, he is in heaven.
    A certain Englishman in Lagos who claimed to be a Christian once had a discussion with one of the ministers of the GKS about heaven. His idea of heaven was that it is a state of good living in this world, and argued that no one could point as to which direction heaven is. However, at the end of the discussion, which took place in his house on his request, he honestly confessed his ignorance of the Bible.
    Under the heading of “heaven and hell”, the Illustrated World Encyclopedia has this to say: “Heaven is the name for the p1ace where good persons are rewarded after they die…People may usually think of heaven as being ‘in the sky’ and hell ‘below the earth’, but in the Christian re1igion there is no exact place where heaven or hell is known or supposed to be.” (Vol. 11, page 2539) This view which many hold is grossly erroneous.
    Theologians
    Even now some who claim to be theologians are doubting the existence of heaven. In the atlantic edition of the TIME magazine issue of May 19, 1967, it was reported that “many theologians are now attempting to redefine heaven and hell in this-worldly terms- not as places where humans survive after death, but as states of mind and modes of being that begin here on earth.” The magazine then quoted Notre Dame’s Jesuit Biblical Scholar, John Mc- Kenzie, as saying, “The traditional views of heaven and hell are about 95% mythology.”
    Earlier in the issue of March 31, 1967, the TIME had reported that heaven and hell were shrugged off as myth by Dominican Theologian Willem van der Marck. He was quoted as saying, “Heaven and hell just do not preoccupy us any more:”
    Here in Nigeria there are also many people who do not believe that there is heaven. In the DRUM magazine, issue of December 1966 the views of some Nigerians about God were published. One of those interviewed was reported to said: “I do not believe that is God who sits in to heaven watch what we do. Neither do believe that there is a place like heaven…
    It is rather amusing to go through this cross-section of views of sceptical men most of which smack of crass spiritual ignorance or delusion.
    We do know that God’s knowledge is infinite – that is, it has no end. But the human intellect has a limit, and so spiritual matters or things that are beyond that limit can never be comprehended by men – no matter how highly developed their reasoning faculty may be. This is the cause of the difficulties of people over spiritual matters. Said St. Paul: “…We speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom teacheth; but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; for they are foolishness unto him; neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.” – 1 Corinthians 2:13, 14.
    Moreover, unless a person has pleasure in the word of God and allows himself to be used by Him through His Spirit as to be able to compare spiritual things with spiritual, he cannot understand His works. The Psalmist declared: “The works of the Lord are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.” – Psalm 111: 2.
    Men have developed a tendency of discarding or disbelieving what they have not the capacity to understand. Concerning God and His works, it is such things as are revealed that we as human beings – imperfect mortals – can know. It was Moses the prophet who said: “The secret things belong unto the Lord our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.” – Deuteronomy 29: 29.
    Unquestionable Truth
    That heaven is a place is an unquestionable truth revealed in the Holy Bible. Where it is, is so clearly shown in the Bible that even a child with little training can point to its direction. It is not a state of the mind or a condition of living. The Bible account of the creation gives a vivid picture of what and where heaven is.
    In Genesis chapter 1, verse 1, it is written: “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth,” The earth was void, there was no form of life, and it was covered with waters. There was darkness all over the earth until light was created. After that, the firmament was also created. “And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament and it was so. And God called the firmament Heaven.” – Genesis I: 6-8.
    The account further states of how the sun, moon and stars were created and placed in the expanse of heaven. “And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also, And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth.” – Genesis I: 16, 17.
    In the face of the foregoing glaring biblical record, it will be unreasonable not to think of heaven as a place or to pretend not to know its location. We standing on this earth cannot point downwards when we talk of the firmament or where the sun, moon and stars are: we must look or point skywards or upwards.
    The word heaven is defined as high or lofty. Thus the cloudy region of the air where birds fly is spoken of as heaven. It is stated that God created “fowls that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.” (Genesis I:20) And Elihu in the book of Job spoke of the birds as “the fowls of heaven.” (Job 35 : 11).
    There is, above the firmament, a vast open space where other planets, the sun, moon and stars. are. And yet above all that there is the heaven where the Almighty God dwells. In the Psalms it is written: “The heaven, even the heavens, are the Lord’s: but the earth hath he given to the children of men.” “The Lord is in his holy temple, the Lord’s throne IS IN HEAVEN: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.” (Ps.115: 16; 11: 4). Heaven is again clearly shown here to be a place; not a state or condition of one’s living.
    The prophet Isaiah wrote: “Thus saith the Lord, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool…” (Isaiah 66: 1; Acts 7: 47-50.) And in the Lord’s Prayer, we say: ‘,Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name” (Matthew: 6 : 9) Jesus Christ teaches us by this that our gracious Spirit Father is in a place called heaven.
    Heaven of heavens
    The Bible shows that there are several heavens but the heaven where God dwells is the highest and is known as “the heaven of heavens”. (Deuteronomy 10: 14; 1 Kings 8:27; 2 Chronicles 2:6) Also, innumerable angels are there. These are spirit creatures who in intelligence, power and in every other respect, are far superior to human beings. (Psalm 8: 3-5; 103: 20; Hebrew 12: 22,23) It was from heaven Jesus Christ came to this earth, and he said: “For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.”
    Indeed, that heaven is a place and is above is therefore beyond argument. Jesus Christ ascended to heaven in the presence of his apostles after he had spoken to them. The Bible states that while they looked at him. “he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight. And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men (angels of God) stood by them in white apparel…” The angels told them that “Jesus is taken up from you into heaven” – Acts 1: 9-11. And St. Paul confirmed that Jesus Christ “ascended up far above all heavens” – that is, the highest heaven or heaven of heavens.-  Ephesians 4: 10: Hebrews 4: 14; 8: 1, etc.
    From all the references of the Bible already explained, it is erroneous to hold the view that heaven does not exist or that it cannot be located. But the question as to who will go to heaven is another subject that will be treated in due course. However, we must point out that the teaching that all good persons go to heaven when they die is without foundation in the Scriptures. If all the good will go to heaven, why did the Psalmist and Jesus Christ say that “the meek shall inherit the earth”? So too the belief that Mary went to heaven with the human body is a figment of imagination.
    If Christian teachers confine themselves to teaching what God says in the Bible, people will not be as ignorant of the Scriptures as they are today. They put aside the Bible and teach fables to misguide innocent people.
    The view that there are seven heavens cannot be substantiated with the Scriptures. The Bible gives the idea of three heavens. St. Paul in his second epistle to the Corinthians wrote about the visions and revelations of the Lord, saying, “I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the THIRD HEAVEN.” – 2 Corinthians 12: 1,2.
    It is very important that we believe that there is heaven where God Almighty dwells and from where we should expect protection and blessing particularly in this atomic age. Where we do not, then we are no Christians and have no protection or hope of salvation. It was James the apostle who stated: “Do not err, my beloved brethren. Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above (Heaven), and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.” – James 1: 16, 17.
    Yes, heaven is a place and it is there God in His Kingdom dwells!`, 
        title:"WHAT AND WHERE IS HEAVEN?"},
     {key:7, 
        content:`ALL over the world evidences of moral degeneration abound. Sexual immorality has posed a problem to which no human answer has been found.
        The more people condemn acts of immorality, the greater the vigour with which majority indulge in them. Men and women who are notorious for their characteristic deviation from the path of virtue are sometimes accorded places of honour.
        Some people are sometimes moved to ask whether God, in fact, laid down any code to guide the conduct of men; and if He did, why men are not keeping to that code of conduct and what God’s attitude towards these things is.
        The Creator, no doubt, had a purpose for bringing man into existence. “This people have I formed for myself,” said He “they shall shew forth my praise.”  – Isaiah 43: 21; see also Psalm 100: 3-5; 79: 13; Revelation 4:11; 14:6,7.
        Ten Commandments
        In order that man may fulfil God’s purpose and prove worthy of his honour, he is required to live up to certain standards of behaviour both in the service or his Creator and in his dealings with his fellow men. To this end God enacted laws to guide His people. Among the laws given in the days of Moses the prophet, the Ten Commandments as written in Exodus chapter 20, were of fundamental significance.
        Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ came and confirmed them but” with modification of grace summing up all of them under LOVE – the love of God and that of one’s neighbour. (Mark 12: 28-31; Romans 13: 10) It is on this royal law or golden rule the principles of Christianity are based. To live up to these principles is to build up a strong moral character that goes with true honour and abiding grace; it is to lead a life of holiness that brings glory and life eternal. But to do otherwise is certainly disastrous.
        It is because people set aside the principles of God and go about following the lusts and devices of their own hearts that crimes and calamities ravage the modern race; that sex perversion becomes the order of the day; and there continues to be deterioration in moral and spiritual values.
        SIN, in one word, is the bane of humanity. It robs man of his honour and glory, and even deprives him of the right to existence.
        Adultery is a sin. And King Solomon said: “But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: be that doeth it destroyeth his own soul. A wound and dishonour shall he get; add his reproach shall not be wiped away.” – Proverbs 6: 32,33.
        Yes, ADULTERY is one of the sins of the people for which God is going to destroy this evil world. (Hosea 4: 1-3; Isaiah 26: 21) So too fornication is an abomination. The apostles of Christ jointly commanded the believers through the Holy Spirit to ABSTAIN FROM FORNICATION and other heathenish practices. (Acts 15: 28, 29) Moreover, it is positively stated in the Bible that NO ADULTERER, ADULTERESS OR FORNICATOR WILL INHERIT GOD’S KINGDOM. – 1 Corinthians 6: 9, 10, 18; Galatians 5: 19-21; Ephesians 5: 3-6.
        Today, adultery and fornication are among those things in which the world takes greater pleasure. This shows how men have gone far away from God and His word.
        Church Leaders
        Certain religious leaders have been found guilty of immorality. It was reported in the front page of the Nigerian Daily  Express of 10th  April, 1961, that “a woman told a Church court in London that she committed adultery 75 to 80 times with a vicar” If the vicar of a Church can be so immoral, what is he expected to say or do when his followers do the same? Practically nothing! – Romans 2:1, 2, 22-27.
        Some Church leaders connive at the immoral behaviours and practices of the members of their organisations because they fear that if they speak out they would lose adherents. Certain male and female members of a church parish were often found after church services making love in a hotel near their place of worship. And when someone called the attention of the pastor in charge to the unwholesome conduct of the members and protested, he received to his chagrin a sharp rebuke from the priest. “Are you the one sent by God to condemn people? or do you want to scatter my Church?” the pastor inveighed. And he added: “The Bible says judge not but let both good and bad grow together till the time of the harvest.”
        This is the way certain preachers quote the Bible like the devil and wrest its passages to suit their own purposes only to deceive the gullible. And with such an irrational attitude and negative approach to matters of this nature which is but a manifestation of lack of spiritual understanding, such priests also contribute to the moral decay prevalent among the folds of many Churches so-called.
        Of a truth, many Church leaders do not in the least have the spiritual dynamism nor reflect the irresistible, awe-striking force of the word of God dreaded by evil-doers nor the reformatory power for which Christianity is renowned.
        There is nothing wrong in judging anyone who acts contrary to the law of God. The elders in the Church are charged with the responsibility not only to judge or rebuke offenders but also to punish them by way of excommunication where they do not repent. This must be done without fear or favour regardless of the social rank or status of the unrepentant sinner.
        When there were reported cases of fornication among the Christians at Corinth, so much that one had union with his father’s wife, St Paul gave stern orders through his epistle that such a person should be judged and expelled from the Church-more so, when there was no evidence of contrition in that person. (1 Corinthians 5: 1-5, 9-13) Such disciplinary measures serve as a deterent to others who may be carried away into similar abuses. What is more, St. Paul also enjoined Timothy, his fellow labourer in the gospel, saying, “Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.” – 1 Timothy 5: 20
        “Civilization”
        What the world has been pleased to call “civilization” is fraught with a number of evil things that sap the moral and spiritual strength of any nation. Here in Nigeria we are witnesses of how it has contributed to lower the moral standard of the present generation.
        We now find ourselves in a world where uprightness of character counts but little, where men and women of proved integrity and rectitude are not as popular as those of corrupt and dissolute disposition. The newspapers and magazines are always there to give prominence to loose women who for material gain and vainglory sell away their feminine honours. The TV programmes are considered to be exciting when they have to do with naked women, love affairs, and other sensual acts.
        For these newspapers and magazines pornographic publications are the spring-board to their social popularity, and indecent advertisements of naked women are their source of more income and economic stability. But it must be made clear that any medium of information that encourages sexual immorality in any way is not only acting contrary to the law of God but is also doing great disservice to humanity.
        The way the devil is using men and women and even children these days is so bad that many sober people are becoming more concerned about where the present generation is heading for.
        There are clubs and theatres where people go simply to engage in sinful, immoral pleasures. Worldly women make obscene appearance on the stage and are greeted with cheers, and those of them who go besides themselves to strip clothes off their, bodies and wriggle themselves dancing in a most indecent manner are given the loudest applause. And you find some who call themselves Christians among them too!
        The other day, the Sunday Times (February 11, 1968, page 3) published its investigation on the question of “sex and the single girl”. The view was expressed that “hardly will you find one out of thirty who is still a virgin”. It was further stated: “Even our men would look down on such girls… They regard these virgins as immature and unsophisticated.” It was also the opinion of some that “chastity is out of date” and “is not fashionable”. These views and others were gathered from Nigerian girls among whom were graduates, clerks, and so on.
        It must be pointed out that men who look down on a girl for being a virgin are themselves depraved characters. And any girl who seeks to please such men by leading a loose life so as to appear sophisticated, modern and fashionable, is stupid and spiritually not better than a beast. SHE SHALL PAY DEARLY FOR HER PERVERSION. – Look up Psalm 49: 12; Proverbs 11: 3; 21: 15,16; 2 Corinthians 5: 10.
        The Sunday Times investigation is but a confirmation of the well known fact that immorality has eaten deep into the fabric of the Nigerian society – even to the extent that the true sense of value of the majority of youths has been contaminated.
        Young girls take extraordinary pride in their age, they abuse their youth forgetting that youth is but a temporal state. In their exuberance they shift from fashion to fashion and adopt all sorts of mannerism – winking of eyes and body movements – all to attract attention of those of the opposite sex. Today mini-skirt is the vogue. They have learned, in Peter Howard’s description, to wear wigs for the delight of men, to paint lips, cheeks, finger-nails, toes, eyes till they are like the colours of a mandrill’s backside. In all these that make for immodesty certain women, some above middle age, would want to compete (godlessly) with the younger generation!
        These things are not good. Mini-skirts should be banned by the Government. Church leaders who are worth their salt must speak out not only in condemnation of vices but also in scattering evils as of a duty but within the limit of their prerogatives as prescribed in the Holy Bible. Governments as well must discourage immoral tendencies in their institutions and departments and take steps to check immorality in the general public. This is of vital importance to the spiritual and moral strength of any nation.
        Some blame the cause of the low morals of youths on parents. It cannot be argued that some parents are not reprehensible. There is an element of truth in the saying that parental delinquency begets youthful delinquency. But there are also instances of children who have perverted to loose life though they were brought up in strict discipline under parents of known integrity, strong character and high morals. Such parents are not to blame but the children who will definitely give account of themselves to God.
        It was King Solomon who said, “Rejoice, O young man (or young woman), in thy youth.; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days’ of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment. Therefore…put away evil from thy flesh: for childhood and youth are vanity.”- Ecclesiastes 11: 9,10.
        Social Evils
        Today a lot of things known to be bad and contrary to morality are done by people without feeling remorse. The sin of fornication and even adultery are taken lightly. There are places where prostitution is legalised and permitted. Married women have the gut to keep boyfriends and are not ashamed to confess having lawless sex relations with other men. Some men on the other hand also boast of the number of girls they have defiled or of women they have succeeded to seduce from their husbands. We pity them. And may God give them repentance – for UNLESS they repent to His satisfaction, they shall get full reward for their heinous sins. – 1 Timothy 1: 9, 10; Hebrews 13: 4; Revelation 21: 7, 8.
        Social gatherings and youth clubs have become fertile grounds for immorality. Some schools also contribute to the moral laxity among the youths. Take for example, the case of male students of a college inviting the students of a Girls’ Grammar School to a week-end or end-of-term dance at the college hall with the approval of the respective principals. The pity of it is that some of such schools are run by certain so-called church denominations!
        With such low moral and spiritual standards in institutions of learning, apart from the secular and materialistic ideas pumped into the students by godless tutors, we agree with the view that a boy or girl finds the school environment a battle-ground rather than a training ground.
        Unrestricted social intercourse between boys and girls not only makes them sex lawlessly and contact diseases but also results in some school girls becoming pregnant and therefore unable to complete their training courses: and others because of shame resort to procuring abortion but die in the process.
        These are some of the evils in human societies that must be condemned without reservation. The Christian boy or girl must resist these temptations and keep himself or herself pure in the fear of God knowing very well that God’s judgment awaits everyone. Evildoers must be brought to face the grim realities of the consequences of their actions.
        Last Days
        It had long been foretold in the Scriptures that evil practices would be rampant among men in this final age of the world. St. Paul described the last days as a time of troubles, and stated that men would be selfish, covetous, blasphemous, unholy, with no respect for parents, wanting in self-control, swollen with self-importance, high-minded and “lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God”. – 2 Timothy 3: 1-5.
        The apostle further stated that those who would endeavour to live a godly life as Christians would be subjected to persecution, whereas “evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived”. – 2 Timothy 3: 12, 13.
        But one thing is clear: it is that God will not continue to tolerate the sins of men indefinitely, iniquity shall have an end.
        God’s Vengeance
        It was the wickedness of men on earth when every imagination of the thoughts of their hearts was evil continually, that provoked the wrath of God and caused the Deluge which destroyed the ungodly in the days of Noah. He (Noah) was found righteous and was saved with his family. – Genesis 6: 5-8; 7: 1-10, 21-24; 2 Peter 2:4,5.
        There is also the instance of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah because of the sins of the inhabitants. Immorality reached such a height that men, burning with lust for one another, committed sodomy-the sin of carnal relation between male persons. When those cities were destroyed Lot, who neither took part nor had pleasure in the sins of the people, was rescued by God through His angels. – 2 Peter 2: 6-10.
        Very soon God will rid the world of all unrighteousness. It is sheer wishful thinking for anybody to hope that he could escape God’s wrath and punishment when he or she does not repent thoroughly of his or her sins. “For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that everyone may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.” – 2 Corinthians 5: 10.
        The severity with which God dealt with those who were guilty of immorality in the days of old is an object lesson to Christians of today, warning them to refrain from sinful lusts. (1 Corinthians 10: 5-11; Romans 11: 20-22) It is because of this understanding that the GKS is firm in the enforcement of discipline expelling from the fold (after ecclesiastical judgment) unrepentant members and even ministers who are guilty of ungodly acts. – Proverbs 11: 31; 1 Corinthians 5: 11-13; 1 Peter 4: 17, 18.
        In a comprehensive admonition to the Church of the Thessalonians, St. Paul stated what every Christian should do for the maintenance of self-respect and dignity in the Lord. As it is written: “This is the will of God, that you should be holy: you must abstain from fornication: each one of you must learn to gain mastery over his body, to hallow and honour it, not giving way to lust like the pagans who are ignorant of God.”– 1 Thessalonians 4: 3-5, New English Bible.
        From the foregoing it is abundantly clear that God is against immorality.`,

        content:`“THE pleasures of sin” are only but for a short time and yet their aftermath is misery and vexation of spirit.
        For the carnal man or woman all that life means to him or her is sex, drinks, dance and such like. He or she therefore indulges in these things quite in excess Contrary to the laws of God. Among the people who have developed such an attitude towards life you find those who say, “Let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die.” When some of them have spent all their savings and consumed all their substance in sinful pleasure but do not die ‘tomorrow,’ they become wretched. And worse still, some will turn round to accuse God for being responsible for their sensualism and miserable state.
        St. Paul showed clearly that people who say, “Let us eat and drink’ for tomorrow we die”, are purposeless and without hope of the life in the world to come. (1 Corinthians 15: 32-34; Isaiah 22: 13, 14) people of such Worldly character, except they repent, can never be true worshipers of God. And if they claim to be Christians, they are not the serious type – and with many of them, going to church services is just pastime. This is true, and we say it without fear.
        Men must realise that unless they lead a life that is pleasing to their Creator, the Almighty God, they gain nothing.  Such a life must be one of high morals and integrity. King Solomon stated: “The integrity of the upright shall guide them: but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them.” – Proverbs 11: 2.
        Civilised Countries
        It is commonly said that the influence of Western civilization is mostly responsible for the high rate of juvenile delinquency and immorality among adults now prevalence in African Countries. In fact, many beautiful aspects of our culture and customs, which make for decency, are now being violated in the name of civilisation, and are really giving way to the modern orgies.
        There is no doubt that, by worldly standards, the countries in Europe and America have developed greatly; but it will be a silly mistake for us to look to those countries for spiritual and moral values. Things are worse there. Honest Europeans and Americans say this too. Let us look to the word of God – the Holy Bible – for guidance.
        In the more civilised countries morality has declined so much that beastly habits are exhibited in the open without shame. Only of recent LIFE magazine (April, 1968) carried a report of how a retired French colonel was provoked by an increasingly common sight in Paris – “huge advertisements on subway station walls showing voluptuous maidens in various stages of undress”. The report added: “The erotic content of French advertising has escalated rapidly of late as if to catch up with art, movies and literature. There are ads showing girls wearing only their nylons, girls wearing only their bras, nude girls, nude men, semi nude girls with nude men and now – voila  –  nude couples.”
        In the United States things have got quite out of hand and the situation is appalling. It was reported that “there were some 275,700 illicit births in 1964″. The figures of illegitimacy keep going up despite the campaign to inspire interest in birth control. “A constantly startling fact pointing to degeneracy of these “last days”, it was reported in the AWAKE (April 22, 1967) “is that girls under seventeen years of age account for about 50,000 annual out-of-wedlock births in America.”
        Under the heading, “Disease Rise”, the AWAKE stated: “‘At least one out of every 250 teenage boys and girls (in the United States) was infected with gonorrhea in fiscal year 1966’, stated a report prepared by several medical associations. The report added: ‘Since actual incidence of infection among all age groups is considered to be four times the reported incidence, the figures presented here considerably understate the seriousness of the problem.'”
        The AWAKE went on, “Last year reported cases of syphilis numbered 22,473 and of gonorrhea, 334,949. Teenage cases of syphilis rose 12.4 per cent in 1964 and 1965. The associations said that gonorrhea presented a particularly difficult public health problem because women could have the disease and not know it and because antibiotic-resistant strains of gonorrhea bacteria were growing in number,”
        “The Evangelist of Truth” in U.S.A. stated: “America is experiencing the worst wave of teenage sex delinquency ever known in the history of the world, and crime is now increasing four times as fast as the population. The entire cause can be laid at the door of the movies, television and rotten literature.”
        No one can claim complete ignorance of the dangers of that tragic illness known as venereal disease. It can lead to blindness, impotence, insanity and death. Yet men and women of uncontrollable sexual passions do contribute to spreading it. The New Zealand Herald (November 10, 1967) reported that “some Auckland girls have come to regard venereal disease as a kind of ‘status symbol’ which boosts them in the eyes of contemporaries who are similarly lacking in morals”.
        Sweden is another place that is notorious for immorality. Now the grave consequences of juvenile delinquency are weighing heavily on that country and the people are already feeling seriously concerned about the situation.
        Swedish teenagers are said to be indifferent to shame and all decent virtues. Boys and girls drink and make love all night. In daylight they pet in public and do not care what the world thinks of them. Whole towns are plagued with screaming nude girls and the blare of transistor radios.
        In the TIT-BITS, issue of the week ending May 23, 1964, a writer had this to say about the incidents of immorality in Sweden:
        “SOMETIMES more than 100 arrests are made in one evening but these are only made after police charges aimed at breaking up mobs of drunken, sex- mad teenagers.
        “The situation is now so serious that 140 Swedish physicians have petitioned King Gustav and the government, asking them to take steps to stop sexual laxity which is a ‘menace to the vitality and health of the nation’.
        “These doctors are not alarmists, In Sweden, pre-marital intercourse is condoned and abortions are legal. What is the result?” asked the writer. He then went on: “Statistics show that gonorrhea has increased nearly 100 per cent in the past five years – and more than 50 per cent of new cases are teenagers. This carefree attitude towards sex, apart from spreading disease, does not even make it enjoyable.” Said Dr. Sigurd Elvin, one of the doctors who signed the petition: “Young people in Sweden are not happy. They lack the Ten Commandments in their upbringings,” (Emphasis ours).
        If those children’s parents had not attached more importance to secular training than spiritual education, if they had brought up those children “in the nurture and admonition of the Lord” (Ephesians 6: 1-4) they would not have been miserable or unhappy as Dr. Sigurd Elvin lamented.
        Bitterness of Sin
        In Britain it is the same story of moral decline, London has been described as “the shocking city” because of whoredom that is rampant there. It was reported that “in 1962 there were 8,835 illegitimate births in London, England, which was one-seventh of all the births recorded in that city for the entire year!”
        There is a school in South London where girls of 11-plus who are pregnant are cared for until they give birth to their children. A visitor to the school once wrote a story published in the TIT- BITS of May 23, 1964, which he captioned: “Heartbreak of the 11-plus Mothers”, It is a story that tens of the bitterness of sin and the meanness of man despite his claim to civilisation. He stated that “girls in this plight have to be lucky to get to the school – it can cope with only 12 girls at a time”.
        The writer told of no less than 1,000-odd girls in a year who became expectant mothers before the official school-leaving age of 15! For them as far as the Ministry of Education is concerned, formal education is finished and there is no place for them to find an escape from the sham and live out their last few months of childhood as children.
        The visitor further wrote: “I learned that often the fathers of the babies these girls are expecting are married men. Some are willing to accept the responsibility and help all they can, but many just leave the frightened girl to cope with the problem herself. Only a few of the prospective fathers are the same age as the girls. And they seldom marry the girl.” Note what the visitor said: “…the fathers of the babies these girls are expecting are married men”. Are many monogamists not fathers of out-of-wedlock children here in Nigeria too? Do some of them not look down on honest polygamists? and do they – the monogamists – not parade themselves as the gentlemen and elites of society? Hypocrites!
        It is clear from the disclosures in this sermon that the standard of morals in some countries abroad is not commendable. It is foolishness and a show of immaturity for anybody therefore to feel that he is better than anyone else just because he has been to any oversea country.
        It is those things that arc good in Western civilisation that we should accept and make use of, but those that are bad must be condemned and thrown off. The tendency to ape everything that comes from Europe or America is one of the factors that are responsible for the moral weakness of our people.
        Loose Dance
        For example, the Western style of dancing in which a man holds a woman, perhaps another man’s wife, on her hip in very close proximity face to face, shoulder to shoulder or breast to breast – is immodest and ungodly. It is unchristian, and it provokes jealousy. “For jealousy is the rage of a man”, says the word of God, (Proverbs 6: 34) Even the African custom does not allow it. But today those who want to be “modern” so as to be classified among the “elites” or “intelligentsia” take pride in doing these things.
        The loose or nominal Christian may take offence and call the GKS names for condemning this type of European dance. For condemning anything we have strong reasons. That this type of European dance is immoral is evidenced by the confession of certain women in the United States.
        “The Chicago Vice Commission in the United States, tried to find why girls ‘went bad’. Over 300 women whose lives were ruined, many of whom were prostitutes, said, ‘My first step wrong was caused by the dance.” (African Challenge, July, 1957, page 5)
        However, we are gratified that from the lectures of the GKS many sober and responsible people have had cause to ponder these things and to refrain from them. They have also stopped their wives and daughters from engaging themselves in such a loose dance.
        Another thing that must be discouraged if moral corruption is to be wiped out of Nigeria and other parts of the world is the concept of “boy and girl friend”. Some men – “gentlemen” – of about 50 years of age feel very happy when they are referred to by young girls of 18 or 20, as their “boy friends”. And so too some old women feel honoured when they are called by young men as their “girl friends”. This is funny; but it is in fact foolishness. In the Lagos Weekend of Friday, July 12, 1968, a writer had this to say: “In Nigeria when a man and a woman refer to each other as ‘my girl friend’ and ‘my boy friend’, the implication is that both of them are entitled to have sexual intercourse together throughout the duration of their friendship.”
        What the devil always does in luring men to sin is first of all to make them develop a carefree attitude so that a sinful act is not considered as anything serious.
        Take a look at the beauty competitions of the world, You will find that the process through which a girt is declared “Miss Mini-skirt”, “Miss Telephone” or “Miss Ilegogoro” is dotted with many things that contravene Christian principles and tradition, For a girl to put on a scanty dress, which nearly exposes her whole body and appear before a group of men regarded as judges, is foolish and repugnant to the Christian mind. It is very sad to note that certain responsible men and women, whom the young generation should look to for guidance in the right path, are putting in every effort to encourage these things. If this is the way we would want Nigeria to match with the times, then there is cause for fear.
        Women generally were created by God in such a way that shamefacedness is a virtue to them. It was St. Paul who stated: “In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; but (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.” – 1 Timothy 2: 9.
        Once a man or woman loses his or her sense of shame, there is no evil thing – no matter how mean it may be – that he or she cannot do. The Bible says “the unjust knoweth no shame.”
        The Sunday Times of July 1, 1968, published an article of a certain girl who said she thanked heavens for being single, As all people cannot be foolish, some responsible married women cried ‘shame’ on her in their replies published in the Sunday Times of July 21, 1968.
        Young women who do not want to marry and who are leading immoral life are not only a “menace to the vitality and health of the nation”, but are also the instruments of destruction. So too foolish married women who are seducing men to committing adultery are a spiritual danger leading the unfaithful and infidels to “the depths of hell”. (Proverbs 9: 12-18) How many young men have had their lives ruined through these devilish women no one can really tell! It is only by the fear of God through the keeping of His commandments that men can escape from the snares of Satan these creatures constitute.
        King Solomon, writing on the conduct of immoral women, stated: “For the commandment (of God) is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life: to keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman. Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelid, For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life “ – Proverbs 6: 23-29.
        Warning
        Concerning the Jews of old St. Paul stated: “But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness…Neither be ye (Christians) idolaters, as were some of them…Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come.” – 1 Corinthians 10: 5-11.
        Men and women everywhere must take warning from what the natural Jew” suffered because of sin. Jesus Christ, knowing the danger of worldliness, gave this warning: “And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day (the day of God’s vengeance) come upon you unawares… Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of Man.” – Luke 21: 34-36.
        Anyone who has a prick of conscience is advised to repent sincerely and put a stop, by Christ’s power, to his immoral living, He can be Sure of God’s pardon, by His grace, notwithstanding how deep he has sunk into the pool of iniquity, “Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon.” – Isaiah 55: 7; see also Proverbs 28: 13, 14; 2 Peter 3: 9.
        You as a Christian are required to live up to the principles of Christianity, You must not set your heart on this godless world, or its attractions, or all the glamour of its life, Let not the ungodly or unprincipled men seduce you with their errors from the lofty way – the way of holiness; but rather keep your foothold on the solid rock of faith, and maintain your integrity to the glory of God for your own salvation. (Proverbs 1: 10; 1 Peter 4: 2-3, 7, 8,) St. Paul says: “Work out your own salvation with (godly) fear and trembling.”`,

     {key:9, 
        content:`ALTHOUGH there is the proposal for Church unity, it is common knowledge that the question as to who is the head of the Church is one of the issues on which there still exists an area of disagreement. The right answer to this question is of paramount importance because it touches on the very foundation of the divine institution that is known as Church.
        The issue of doctrines is very important in the Christian Faith. St. Paul warned Timothy, a bishop in the early Church, to guard the doctrines of God jealously and charged him to warn others to “TEACH NO OTHER DOCTRINE”. – 1 Timothy 1: 3; 4: 16; see also Galatians 1: 8, 9, A. V.
        It is an article of faith of the Roman Catholic Church that Peter the apostle was the ‘rock’ upon which Jesus Christ built his Church and that Peter was chosen to be the “Head of the Church” and the “Chief of the Apostles”. Linked with this is the claim that every Pope or Bishop of Rome is a successor of St. Peter.
        The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Baltimore, James Cardinal Gibbons, stated: “The Catholic Church teaches also that our Lord conferred on St. Peter the first place of honor and jurisdiction in the government of His whole Church, and that the same spiritual supremacy has always resided in the Popes, or Bishops of Rome, as being the successors of St. Peter.” (The Faith Of Our Fathers, Eighty-third Revised Edition, page 78.)
        A Catholic Dictionary, Second Edition, Revised, defines the “Church of Christ” as “the visible religious society… instituted directly by Christ. under one head, St. Peter and his successors, the popes.. .” (Page 97).
        A Roman Catholic magazine – the Catholic Voice, issue of June 1956 – had this to say: “…Our Divine Lord called Peter the ‘rock’ on which His Church would be built …” (page 81). And answering a question as to why our Lord appeared to St. Peter, the Catholic Voice of July 1956, stated: “…We presume that He did so because He had chosen Peter to be the Head of His Apostles and the Church.” (Page 102)
        The issues involved in this matter are very serious and are of tremendous spiritual interest to both Roman Catholics and Protestants alike as well as any other person who desires to acquire an accurate knowledge of the Christian Faith. It is the more interesting that the Roman Catholic Church bases its teaching about the primacy of Peter not merely on ‘tradition’ but on the Scripture.
        Holy Bible
        We must admit that the awakening of the interest of the Catholics in the Holy Bible is a significant development in Christendom. Under the heading, “BACK TO THE BIBLE”, a Catholic newspaper, the INDEPENDENT of October 16-22, 1966, published: “One effect of the Ecumenical Council has been to re-awaken our interest in the Bible…Not only must Priests find in the Bible the source of their sacred learning, nourishment for their interior life and substance for the instruction of their people, but the people, too, should be encouraged and helped to read the sacred scriptures for themselves.” In Course No. 6 of the “Catholic Enquiry Centre”, published at Owerri, Nigeria, it is positively stated: “And for a Catholic the whole Bible is the word of God…It is a Catholic teaching that there is no error in the Bible.”
        We of the God’s Kingdom Society always endeavour to keep an open mind towards one and all. It is our policy to call a spade a spade, or truth, truth, no matter who says it because we firmly believe that the truth belongs to God. Therefore, if the Roman Catholics are right we must sincerely admit that they are right, but if they are wrong, yes, we should not only say so but we should also prove from the Holy Bible, which they believe is “the word of God”, that they are wrong.
        Indeed, we quite agree with Rev. John Laux, M. A., author of A Course in Religion for Catholic High Schools and Academies (Part III) when he stated that we should enlarge our knowledge, cultivate our reason, “to get an insight in- to the relation of truth to truth; to learn to view things as they are”.
        Now let us turn to the Holy Bible to get an insight into the relation of scripture to scripture about the truth of the question, “Who is the Head of the Church?” In order to avoid misgivings and for the benefit of our Catholic friends, all Bible references in this sermon, except otherwise expressly stated, are from the Douay Version which some call ‘Roman Catholic Bible’.
        This Rock
        When Jesus Christ came to the coasts of Cesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples: “Who do men say that the Son of man is?” Some people, the disciples told him, said John the Baptist, some Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets. Jesus then asked: “But who do you say that I am?” Simon Peter replied, “Thou art Christ, the Son of the Living God.” (Matthew 16:13-16) Following this reply, Jesus said: “Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jona; because flesh and blood hath not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in heaven. And I say to thee that: Thou art Peter: and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.”- Matthew 16: 17, 18.
        What has been described as the “charter of the Papacy” is drawn from this declaration of Christ. Thus in answer to Question 88, The Explanatory Catechism states: “I know that Christ appointed St. Peter to be the Head of the Church, because Christ said to him: ‘Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build My Church…’ (Matt. xvi. 18, 19.)”
        At this juncture, we must say outright that the interpretation given the text by the Roman Catholic Church has given cause for dispute among Christians because some believe that Jesus Christ NEVER made Peter the head of the Church. No one, apart from Jesus Christ himself or God’s word in the Bible, is competent to settle this dispute. Jesus Christ, it is clear in the Bible, did not say St. Peter is the rock; neither did he say that the church was built upon him nor that he was the head of the Church. Rather Jesus Christ himself is the rock upon which the Church is built, and he is the head of the Church. The truth of this in the Bible is so clear that there is no room for doubt for anyone who keeps his mind free from prejudice.
        When Jesus said, “Thou art Peter”, we know as a rule in grammar that Peter was the second person. And when Christ added, “and upon THIS rock”, we can as well understand that he was no longer referring to the second person – Peter. If peter were the rock, Christ would have said, “Thou art Peter, and upon thee, the rock, I will build my church”. The contrast between “THOU” and “THIS” should not be confused. So when he said, “and upon THIS rock”, Christ was pointing to him- self, the Son of the Living God, as the one upon whom the Church would be built.
        In fact, he is the rock or foundation stone. This fact is strengthened by St. Paul’s statement concerning the natural Jews, to wit: “And all drank the same spiritual drink; (And they drank of the spiritual rock that followed them; and THE ROCK WAS CHRIST.)” – 1 Corinthians 10: 4.
        The Foundation
        The “Catholic Truth Society” of London stated in a pamphlet, What Do You Know about St. Peter and His Successors…: “One such essential feature of the Church was undoubtedly the authority of St. Peter. It was the foundation, and what could be more essential to any building than the foundation? If the foundation changes, the building changes. Our Lord actually compared His Church to a building erected on the foundation of St. Peter’s authority.”
        We agree that Jesus Christ likened the Church to a building but there is no passage in the whole Bible which states that St. Peter is the foundation of the Church.
        Long before the human existence of Jesus Christ it had been foretold that he would be a stone to be laid by God in Zion for a foundation-a stone, though rejected by human builders, that would still become the head-stone. (Psalm 117: 22,23; Isaiah 28: 16) Referring to Jesus Christ, St. Peter said to the Jews: “This is the stone which was rejected by you, the builders, which is become the head of the corner…” – Acts 4: 10- 12; 1 Peter 2: 6.
        The name Peter, from the Greek word Petros means a stone. It was Christ himself who called Simon, his apostle, Peter (John 1: 42) which spiritually signifies strong faith in God. Other faithful servants of Christ are also stones. That was why St. Peter wrote to the Christians: “Be you also as living stones built up, a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.” And turning to the prophecy relating to Christ, he added : “Wherefore it is said in the Scripture: Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner-stone, elect, precious… “- I Peter 2: 3-8.
        All the apostles make up the “Little Flock” but there are the “other sheep” whom Christ promised to gather. (Luke 12: 32; John 10: 16) Both the apostles, including Peter, who are the foundation members in the sense of being the predestinated and first fruits of Christ’s disciples, and the “other sheep” are all built on ONE foundation, which is Christ. Said St. Paul: “Now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners; but you are fellow citizens with the saints and the domestics of God, built upon the foundation of the APOSTLES and PROPHETS (note – NOT Peter alone, but all the apostles). Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner-stone, in who m (Christ, not Peter) all the building, being framed together, groweth up into an holy temple in the Lord. In whom (Christ) you also are built together into an habitation of God in the Spirit.” – Ephesians 2: 19-22.
        Whatever remains in the argument of the Catholics, if any at all, is knocked out by St. Paul when he stated: “For other foundation no man can lay, but that which is laid: WHICH IS CHRIST JESUS.”- I Corinthians 3:11.
        Saint Peter was at no time given supreme power over the other apostles. If by Christ’s saying “Thou art Peter” and so forth, he was understood by the apostles to have made Peter their head, why was it that after that occasion they still “disputed among themselves, which of them should be the greatest”? Even then Jesus did not say Peter was greater than anyone of them but he said, “For he that is the lesser among you all he is the greater.” – Mark 9: 33, 34; Luke 9: 46-48.
        St. Paul whose wisdom was commended by St. Peter, laboured more than all the apostles (1 Corinthians 15: 10) and he did not consider himself inferior to Peter or any other apostle. He said: “For in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.” – 2 Corinthians 12: 11; 11: 5, King James or Authorised Version (A. V.).
        St. Peter recognised that he was an elder or an overseer just as other apostles were. He wrote: “The elders which are among you I exhort, who AM ALSO AN ELDER, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed: feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof…” (1 Peter 5: 1-3, A.V.) He did not say he was the only elder or head of the apostles.
        That Christ Jesus is the head of the Church and not St. Peter, there is no doubt. Concerning Christ it is written: “…And He (God Almighty) hath subjected all things under his (Christ’s) feet and hath made him (Christ) head over all the Church…” – Ephesians I: 19-23.
        Exhorting the Christians in regard to the duties of husband and wife, Saint Paul used the relationship between Christ and the Church as an example, and showed that Jesus Christ, not Peter. is the head of the Church. Said he: “Let women be subject to their husbands, as to the Lord; because the husband is the head of the wife, AS CHRIST IS THE HEAD OF THE CHURCH. He is the saviour of his body. Therefore, as the church is subject to Christ (not Peter, we reiterate) so also let the wives be to their husbands in all things.” – Ephesians 5: 22-24.
        What is more, Saint Paul described Jesus Christ as “the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature”. He added: “And he (Christ) is the HEAD OF THE BODY, THE CHURCH; who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things he (Christ) may hold the primacy; because in him, it hath well pleased the Father that all fullness should dwell…” – Colossians 1: 15-20.
        The truth of the matter is already made bare. Some may ignore it or argue it – it remains the truth, God’s word of truth says that God “hath made him (Christ, NOT Peter) Head over all the Church”. All we can do, if we are true to our conscience, is to accept the truth for our own good in the Lord. “For we can do nothing against the truth; but for the truth.” (2 Corinthians 13: 8) And Jesus said, “You shall know the truth; and the truth shall make you free.”`,

        content:`THE confidence that prayers, which are in accord with the will of God, are answered is an essential ingredient of faith in the Christian Religion. It is a person who lacks such confidence that sees nothing good in praying to the Almighty God.
        Prayer is a solemn petition or request or giving of thanks to God. It is an act of worship that pre-supposes the insufficiency of the person saying it, and his dependence on God.
        Instances of prayers that were answered by God abound in the Holy Bible. When the Israelites were suffering under the bondage of the Egyptians during their sojourn in Egypt, they cried to God. “And God heard their groaning, and God remembered His covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob…” (Exodus 2: 23-25) As a result of this, God, through His angel, chose Moses and sent him to Egypt to deliver the children of Israel from servitude. To Moses He said: “Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them. Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.” (Exodus 3: 9, 10). The success that crowned the mission of Moses is a well known fact of Bible history.
        Hannah was one of the two wives of Elkanah, the son of Jeroham. The other woman, Peninnah, had children but, Hannah whom their husband loved more was barren. She was made an object of reproach by her enemies because she had no child. However, she believed that God Almighty could give her the desire of her heart. She went into the temple and, in the bitterness of her soul, earnestly prayed to the Lord. In her prayer she vowed and said: O Lord of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine hand- maid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his life…” – 1 Samuel 1:9-11.
        As Hannah prayed silently, Eli the priest, who sat beside the door-post of the temple, observed that her lips moved but her voice was not heard. He thought that she was drunk and went on to scold her. “How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee”, chided the priest. But Hannah promptly answered: “No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the Lord. Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.”- 1 Samuel 1: 12-16.
        As soon as Eli heard her reply, he blessed her to go in peace, and added: “And the God of Israel grant thee thy petition…”
        God’s due time came that Hannah’s prayer was answered. She conceived and gave birth to a male child whom she called Samuel meaning asked of God. (1 Samuel 1: 17- 20) When she brought the child to the temple for presentation according to Jewish custom, she reminded the priest, Eli, that she was the woman who stood by him in the temple praying to the Lord. She then said: “For this child I prayed; and the Lord hath given me my petition which I asked of him: therefore also I have lent him to the Lord; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the Lord.” (1 Samuel 1: 24-28) This is another good example to show that God answers prayers.
        Divine Force
        Let us go a step further under the reign of King Hezekiah the cities of Judah were invaded by Assyria – a very hostile enemy to them in those days. The King of Assyria, Sennacherib, boasted of his might and blasphemed the God of Israel. He issued threats and warned Hezekiah and his people not to put their trust in the Lord their God nor think that they could be delivered from his hand. He then sent a letter, in which he reproached the Most High, to Hezekiah.
        On receipt of the letter, Hezekiah went into the house of God and prayed. Among other things he said: “Incline thine ear, O Lord, and hear; open thine eyes, O Lord, and see: and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent to reproach the living God…Now therefore, O Lord our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the Lord, even thou only.” – Isaiah 37: 14-20.
        In answer to the prayer of Hezekiah, God defended Jerusalem, and His angel went out and killed 185,000 men in the Assyrian camp. Thus the king of Assyria, despite his boasts, threats and I blasphemies, found his army woefully defeated and was compelled by divine force to retreat to Nineveh where he lived. There, again, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch, his god, his own sons fell upon him and killed him with their swords. That was the ignominious end of that godless man. Read Isaiah chapters 36 and 37 for the details of this interesting account.
        Indeed, Jehovah, the Almighty God, is reputed for His wonderful acts which He did among His people in the days of old in answer to their prayers. David the king and prophet, who also derived great benefits from prayers, exclaimed in his song: “Praise waiteth for Thee, O God, in Sion…O Thou that hearest prayer, unto Thee shall all flesh come.”– Psalm 65:1,2.
        Prayer is a very good thing. It is forceful; it gives comfort and hope, and strengthens our will and faith. Through prayers, the ancient worthies – holy men and women of old – did and achieved great things. “The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much”, said James the apostle. He then went on to show how the prophet Elijah “prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months. And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit”. – James 5: 16-18.
        Whatever is our need, let us take it to the Lord in prayer; and provided it is not tainted with sin, He will grant us the desire of our hearts. We as Christians are admonished never to be anxious for anything, “but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God”. – Philippians 4: 6.
        God’s Time
        When some people pray and they do not get what they ask for within a month, six months, a year or two, they grow impatient and become lukewarm in their religious devotions. They, having developed a feeling of hopelessness, and lost faith in the Almighty God, turn to seek aid from idols, witch-doctors and so forth. This is very bad of those professing to be Christians. We must know that whatever we pray for will be granted us not according to our will but God’s will, and in His own due time. We are therefore required to wait on the Lord (Psalm 27: 13, 14), and it is commonly said that “God’s time is the best”.
        For the faithful worshipper, God’s denial of his request is no cause for despair or unhappiness because he trusts that whatever the all-wise God does is the best. It was this understanding that made Jesus Christ say in his prayer to the Heavenly Father, “not my will, but thine, be done”. What we may consider to be good for us may turn out to work against our well-being. We should therefore leave things to God and accept His decision always.
        Furthermore, we should learn to be patient. Take for example the case of Zacharias and his wife, Elisabeth. It is on record that “they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless”, but they had no child, even though they prayed for it, until they were well stricken in years. (Luke 1: 5-7) When it was God’s time, as Zacharias officiated as a priest in the temple, an angel of the Lord appeared to him and said: “Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John ” – Luke 1: 8-14.
        True to the word of the angel, Elisabeth became pregnant and in her old age she brought forth a man child who grew and became the famous fore-runner of Christ our Saviour. We can see how it is rewarding to be patient in waiting on the Lord while continuing to practise righteousness.
        Obstacle
        Sin is an obstacle to prayers. Many prayers are not answered due to sin, or because the people “ask amiss” (i.e. in the wrong way) for their selfish ends. As it is written: “Behold, the Lord’s hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear: but your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.” –  Isaiah 59: 1, 2; see also James 4: 3.
        It is true, God does not hear sinners but if any sinner repents and worships Him in truth, his prayers will be answered. “Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth His will, him He heareth.” (John 9: 31) And John the apostle stated: “And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.” – 1 John 3: 22.
        If a wicked man prays, as some often do, and his desire is accomplished, we should know that it is not God that answers his prayer but the mimic god, Satan the devil, who is the author of evil. A thief can pray so that he may succeed to break into people’s houses and make away with their goods, and he may really be successful in his operation. It ” is not God that helps him but the arch-enemy of God and man, Satan. How can God help, him when he is acting contrary to God’s law which says, “Thou shalt not steal”? All things or wealth acquired by evil means are under curse. God will surely punish the evildoer. (Job 20: 4-8; Proverbs 11:21; 13: 11; Isaiah 3:11) The Bible says that God does not help an evildoer. (Job 8: 20) And it is also written: “He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law (of God), even his prayer shall be abomination.” – Proverbs 28: 9; see also Psalm 66: 18; Proverbs 15: 29.
        Prayer of Faith
        Unless we pray in line with the will of God, we should not expect our prayers to be answered. Saint John stated: “And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, be heareth us: and if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions ‘that we desired of him.” – 1 John 5: 14, 15.
        All prayers must be directed to God ONLY through His Son, Jesus Christ, whom He made the mediator between Himself and men. This is important. Prayers through any other medium are’ not answered by God. – John 14: 13, 14; 15: 16; Ephesians 5: 20; 1 Timothy 2: 5, 6.
        It is also a matter of must that FAITH must underlie our prayers if they are meant to serve any useful purpose. Jesus said: “And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, BELIEVING, ye shall receive.” (Matthew 21: 22) Saint James enjoined that whoever lacks wisdom should ask of God who gives to all men liberally and he added: “But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. For let not that (FAITHLESS) man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.” (James 1: 5-7) It was the same apostle who said: “Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. …Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him and the PRAYER OF FAITH shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.” – James 5: 13-15.
        Jesus Christ warned that we should not behave like hypocrites who “love to pray standing in: the synagogues and in the Corner of the streets, that they may be seen of men”. Rather we should say our prayers in private’, “and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly”. The habit of shouting, “Jesu, Jesu” (as if Jesus is deaf) – and repeating words over and over again, .as some do, is unchristian. Jesus Christ said that’ when ye pray, use not vain repetitions” – Matthew 6: 5-8.
        Now that it has been established beyond all doubt that God answers prayers, we must form the habit of praying always, particularly in this sin-ridden and dangerous age in which we are living. (Luke 21:25-28, 33-36; 1 Timothy 2:1-4) Jesus Christ in a parable taught “that men ought always to pray, and not to faint”.  (Luke 18:1-8) And St. Paul exhorted: “Pray without ceasing.” (1 Thessalonians 5:17) This does not mean that we should lose all sense of moderation, and pray frantically and fanatically.  There is time for everything. (Ecclesiastes 3:1-8) Except one is suddenly face with danger, which could make one pray or call on God excitedly for help, one should always be cool and sober when praying.
        In conclusion, let us remember at all times the admonition of Saint Peter: “But the end of all things is at hand: BE YE THEREFORE SOBER, AND WATCH UNTO PRAYER” – 1 Peter 4:5`, 
        title:"DOES GOD ANSWER PRAYER?"},
     {key:11, 
        content:`A WOMAN, by reason of her faith, knowledge and good understanding, can rise to a place of honour in the Church but there are offices and privileges which God never assigns to women.
    
        In certain church denominations women are allowed to stand in the pulpit before a mixed congregation to preach sermons or read out lessons, or say prayers on behalf of all others. When Dr. Billy Graham visited Nigeria some years ago, a certain woman mounted the pulpit at his campaign meeting at the Race Course, now Tafawa Balewa Square, Lagos, on Saturday January 30, 1960, and led, in an ill vocation or prayer, a vast congregation made up of bishops, apostles, evangelists, priests and so forth. However, in an open letter to the doctor evangelist published in the local newspapers then, the GKS showed from the Scriptures the impropriety of that practice.
        
        There are those who send out their women to preach in the streets and from house to house. Some of these women do claim to have received the anointing of the Holy Spirit or to have been ordained by God to preach the gospel. Among those who regard themselves as prophetesses are some whose mission is to go along the streets ringing bells in the early morning to wake people from bed and shouting, “Wake and pray.’ in their tribal tongues. Thus we find that in certain church groups every other member is either a prophet or prophetess-and all claim to see visions and prophesy. So, people have been asking to know the true position of women in the Church.
        
        We have often said that a number of wrong things are being done by many who claim to be Christians. This is so because the rules and doctrines of Jesus Christ as set out in the Scriptures are often relegated to the background and substituted with men’s invented dogmas.
        
        There is not a single instance in the Bible of a woman who was ordained by God as a prophetess to teach or lead His people.
        
        Presumptuousness
        
        Some women were improperly called prophetesses in the Bible simply because they played some roles in the affairs of God’s people. Nobody can prove that God ordained any of them. Miriam, the sister of Moses and Aaron, was called a prophetess as recorded in Exodus 15: 20, just because she led the women of Israel (not men) in a victory dance after the Egyptians were drowned in the Red Sea. To show that she was not ordained to be a prophetess, God punished her with leprosy when she joined Aaron to assume that God was also using them, and they murmured against Moses. They said: “Hath the Lord indeed spoken only by Moses? Hath he not spoken also by us? “Because of this God was angry, and He said: “If there be a prophet among you, I the Lord will make myself known unto him in a vision, and will speak unto him in a dream… Wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses? And behold, Miriam became leprous, white as snow…” (Numbers 12: 1-15). It is worthy of note that Aaron was not punished – indeed he was ordained a priest – but Miriam suffered for her presumptuous.
        
        As regards men like Moses, Joshua, Daniel, David, Elijah, Isaiah, Jeremiah and a host of others, it is clearly shown in the Bible that they were ordained by God. But who can cite any instance to show that God appointed any woman at any time to lead or teach His people?
        
        It is a shame for men to be led by women in God’s Organisation, and above all, it is contrary to the will of God. Men ought to rule or lead women. It was when the Jews because of their sins were forsaken by God that women dominated them. And God said: “As for my people, children are their oppressors and women role over them. O my people, they which lead thee cause thee to err, and destroy the way of thy paths.” – Isaiah 3:12.
        
        The Roman Catholic Church is aware of the position of women, and they do not allow them to fulfil the functions of priests. Answering a question as to why Rev. Sisters are not allowed to say mass, the Catholic Voice of July 1956, stated among other things: “Since our Divine Lord chose only men as His Apostles so only men can become priests.” And a Catholic newspaper, the INDEPENDENT or March 10-16, 1968, stated: “Men only can receive the Sacrament of Holy Orders: this is the law of God. Christ called men only to the apostolate, and ordained men only to the priesthood…” Obviously, this is the truth and the Roman Catholic Church gets our support.
        
        When the Church of Sweden proposed to ordain women priests, the then Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Fisher, warned the Archbishop of Sweden that “if Sweden ordains women priests, relations between the two churches will be broken off.” (Vide the British Daily Sketch, January 15, 1959)
        
        Foible of Watchtower
        
        In the Salvation Army, they have women ministers who perform the same duties as men. For this, they were severely criticised by the Watchtower Society. In the Watchtower magazine issue of September 1, 1962, page 540, the Watchtower Society wrote: “An unusual feature of the organisation is the prominence accorded women…As a result; women have had much to do with the direction and policy of the Salvation Army, often taking the oversight of men. In fact, for thirty years Evangeline Booth served as the head of the Salvation Army in the United States, and for five years directed the entire world-wide organisation…In granting women equal ministerial privileges the Salvation Army does not follow Bible precedent…” (Emphasis ours)
        
         It can be recalled that the question of women claiming to be anointed or ordained by God to preach from house to house is one of the doctrinal issues on which the first President of the God’s Kingdom Society, Brother G. M. Urhobo, disagreed with the Watchtower Society and for which he was persecuted and is still being slandered by those people who call themselves Jehovah’s Witnesses. Many of their women claim to be anointed, and the latitude given the women had caused trouble in that organisation. In the book, LIGHT Book One, the Watchtower Society stated: “One of the original incorporators of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society was a woman, the wife of the president thereof, and she insisted on editing The Watch Tower and, being resisted, led other women to take a wrongful course against the Lord’s work … Even to this day the same influence attempts to interfere with the Lord’s work … The Lord had pointed out that the woman has her place in the church, but her place is not to teach man nor attempt to influence man in his rightful performance of duty as a servant of the Lord.” (Pages 30-31, emphasis ours) But we ask: If women are ordained by God to preach why should the wife of the President who claimed to be ordained be “resisted” for insisting on editing the Society’s magazine when she was not proved to be inefficient? If the women receive the same anointing which the men have and which put both sexes on equal spiritual status as the Watchtower Society is teaching there should be no reason why the women should be prevented from discharging the duties for which they are ordained. Here lies the foible of the Watchtower Organisation!
        
        The Law
        
        The truth, as the GKS has always maintained, is that God has never ordained or anointed any woman to be a preacher or teacher. If it were God’s will that women should hold such a post in His organisation, Jesus Christ would have: shown an example by choosing one woman, at least, to be an apostle. But he did not, and even when he selected other 70 disciples whom he sent out, two by two, no woman was included. (Matthew 10: 1-7; Mark 3: 13-19; Luke 10: 1-17) Though Jesus Christ had many women disciples, he did not send any of them to go about preaching.
        
        It is contrary to the Christian rule for a woman to teach and lead men. St. Paul stated: “Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence. For Adam was first formed, then Eve. And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression. Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.” (1 Timothy 2: 11-15) St. Paul did not say that women would be saved if they preached from house to house or in the street.
        
        Women are described by St. Peter as “weaker vessels” and in modern terms they are known as the “softer sex”. To send them to go from house to house preaching is tantamount to exposing them to temptations. Modesty will restrain us from going into the details of certain reports about some women that have come to light in connection with their house-to-house preaching activities.
        
        For allowing Jezebel who posed to be a prophetess to teach and to seduce men to commit fornication, the Church of Thyatira was rebuked. The Lord said: “Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication…” – Revelation 2: 20-23.
        
        The Watchtower Society’s members cannot claim to be ignorant of these Bible facts. In their book, “Equipped for Every Good Work” (page 322), they commented on St. Paul’s epistle to Timothy thus: “… The woman is not to usurp authority over the man, but is to learn in silence and not be suffered to teach in the congregation or assembly. This is the Theocratic order.” (Emphasis ours) From this it would appear that they understand that women are not ordained to be teachers or preachers. But the practice among them up till today is quite the opposite of the “Theocratic order”!
        
        Women must not make speeches in the congregation or assembly of the Lord’s people. Even if they have doubt on any issue, the law estops them from asking questions in the church. As it is written: “Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law. And if they will learn anything, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.” (1 Corinthians 14: 34, 35) It was on the basis of this authority we criticised Dr. Billy Graham when he allowed a woman to lead a congregation of bishops, deacons, and so on, in prayer at his campaign meeting.
        
        In violation of the law of God quoted above, the Watchtower Society allowed Miss V. Dougaluk, Miss M. Hinds and Miss R. M. Dreyer to address an international assembly of” Jehovah’s Witnesses” at the Yankee Stadium, New York City, U.SA., on July 23, 1953, This was published in the Report of New World Society Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Yankee Stadium – New York City, July 19-26, 1953 at page 29. In the same report it was published on page 77, that “U.V. Glass gave sound advice to the sisters” – female members. He said among other things that a woman should not be upset “when a brother tries to counsel her”, He added: “She should comment at meetings, but should not try to be a ‘one-woman meeting.’ She will do better by giving others a chance to comment,” Does this advice not run counter to the law of God as stated by St. Paul? The law says, “IT IS NOT PERMITTED UNTO THEM (women) TO SPEAK”! Why should she “comment at meetings”?
        
        GKS Vindicated
        
        In a recent publication, Life Everlasting in the Freedom of the Sons of God, the Watchtower Society treated at length “The Places of Man and Woman in God’s Arrangement”, and therein they have come to agree with the GKS at last that women had never been ordained by God as priests, prophets, apostles or bishops. The following extracts from the book are quite explicit:
        
        “The one whom Jehovah God raised up to liberate the twelve tribes of Israel from Egyptian slavery was a man, Moses the son of Amram. The ones whom God chose to do priestly service to him in behalf of the nation of Israel were men, the man Aaron and his sons…God made no arrangement for priestesses…” (Page 248).
        
         “Then the time came for Jesus to pick out twelve workers to be with him all the rest of his earthly ministry, whom did he pick? Men, twelve of them, and he sent them forth as apostles, Likewise, when he sent out seventy additional evangelizers, it was men that he selected for this privilege of service. (Luke 10: 1-17) In such choosing Jesus was following God’s pattern. Some women in proper circumstances enjoyed some privileges in connection with Jesus, but not those of the twelve apostles and the seventy evangelizers.” (Page 250, emphasis ours)
        
         “It becomes plain that the Most High God Jehovah followed the same dealing with regard to the Christian ‘Congregation of God,’ or spiritual Israel, as he did with regard to the Jewish congregation of pre-Christian times, or natural, circumcised Israel. That is to say, God gave the preference to the males, the men, as regards official responsibilities within the theocratic organisation. This fact is emphasised for us in Ephesians 4:7-13… In that quotation from Paul’s letters the words ‘apostles,’ ‘prophets,’ evangelizers,’ shepherds and teachers are ALL in the masculine gender… In full accord with this, when the apostle Paul writes to Timothy about the qualifications for the service positions of ‘overseers’ and of ‘ministerial servants’ in the congregation, he specifically states that they must be men… (1 Timothy 3: I-10, 12)” (Pages 255- 256, emphasis ours).
        
        Surely, the foregoing excerpts are a vindication of Brother Gideon Urhobo and the God’s Kingdom Society. And we thank God.
        
        Good Works
        
        Although women have important duties to do in God’s organisation, they must not be vested with authority to lead or teach men, neither must they be allowed to address the church.
        
        The example of Jezebel is enough to warn any group of Christians to refrain from permitting their women to peddle with the word of God. There are other good works women should do in support of God’s work so as to be saved.
        
        In the days of Jesus Christ on earth, he praised very highly a certain woman for her good work when she poured very precious ointment on his head. The woman did not preach, yet Jesus said concerning her: “Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.” – Matthew 26: 6-13.
        
        We are not saying that a woman cannot talk God’s word at all – either by teaching her child the fear of God or preaching to another woman. She can, and that does not make her to be ordained by God. St. Paul stated that the aged women should “teach the younger women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children, to be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.” – Titus 2: 3-5.
        
        Note that St. Paul says that the women should be “keepers at home” and not house to house trotters. Rather, it is women who have cast off their faith that wander about. Concerning such women, St. Paul wrote: “And withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.” (1 Timothy 5: 13) The apostle then advised: “I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.” (Verse 14).
        
        Some people think that it is by preaching only that one can be saved. This is very wrong and misleading. To put woo men forward, posing as having been ordained by God, to preach IS A SIN. We should learn from the fate of Miriam and Jezebel. As the Watchtower Society rightly put it in their criticism of the Salvation Army, “in granting women equal ministerial privileges the Salvation Army does not follow Bible precedent”. And we add that any Church group which allows their women to preach in the streets and from house to house DOES NOT follow Bible precedent.
        
        If we as Christians know that we are not to do our will but the Lord’s, and if discipline and decency are to be maintained in the Church of God, it is very important that Christian principles and tradition as explained in this sermon must be adhered to. What is more, St. Paul says: “Let all things be done decently and in order.” God is against lawlessness, presumptuousness and confusion. – 1 Corinthians 14: 33.40.`,

        content:`THE tongue of man is a very small member of the human body but what is in its power is great. It can be a source of blessing, spiritually or materially, and contrariwise, the same tongue is able to set the whole body on fire or trouble that is beyond human control.

        The way many people talk glibly now-a-days without caring a damn gives the impression that some – and they are great in number – do not know how to use the tongue aright.

All sorts of loose talks and perverse words come out of their mouths. At motor parks, in hotels, pubs, and even in some offices or when travelling in lorries, buses and so forth, men and women engage freely in irresponsible and indecorous talks. No word is considered too indecent or filthy for them to utter.
        All these bespeak how far away from righteousness or how corrupt men’s minds are. They make us cast our minds in retrospect to the events that led to the utter destruction of the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah by God in the days of old. But Lot, the nephew of Abraham, who kept himself away from the immorality of the Sodomites was saved. The Bible states that when he was in the midst of the ungodly, he was always vexed with the filthy conversations of the people. And St. Peter, in a really passionate vein, wrote in his epistle about this aspect of the experience of Lot thus: “For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds.” – 2 Peter 2: 7. 8.
        Corrupt Communication
        You may come across a man – call him a gentleman – who is well dressed and who appears sophisticated, walking in a way that commands dignity. But let him utter a word and you will be amazed to find that he is not better than a brute. Invite him into a conversation for a moment, you will be more astonished to notice that though the “gentleman” has gained mastery of all the grammar one can find in the text books, he has not the sense to distinguish between “holy conversation” and “profane language”.
        By the utterances of a person one can judge the sort of character he is. “For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.” Some people who like to talk much pour out most of the time words of no wisdom or profit, and thus they make themselves a laughing- stock before others. It is good to learn how to talk, when to talk, where and what to talk. There is a worldly saying that “he knows most who speaks least”. And the Scriptures put it in a clearer light: “He that hath knowledge spareth his words: and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit. Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise; and he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of under- standing.”– Proverbs 17: 27,28.
        Christians are warned against inconvenient jesting, foolish talks and unwholesome words. In Ephesians 4: 29, St. Paul admonished: “Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.” Furthermore, he said: “But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints; neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks. For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the; kingdom of Christ and of God.” – Ephesians 5: 3-7.
        Do some who call themselves Christians not indulge in these things? Let them judge themselves and repent so that they may be at peace with God.
        False Witness
        There are some people who use their tongues in telling lies, either in preaching the word of God or in bearing false witness against their neighbours, thus putting innocent peop1e in trouble. Some liars have the devilish boldness to appear even in the law courts to swear on the Holy Bible in the name of God. But the first sentences from their mouths in evidence are but a bundle of lies! They do not fear God, yet they swear in His name. , Except such ones repent and put a stop to their ungodly acts, God’s fiery judgment is certainly awaiting them for taking His name in vain. – Exodus 20: 7; Leviticus 19: 12; James 5: 12.
        In the days of Jeremiah the prophet there existed such treacherous fellows and he bewailed their sins because he knew that the Lord of hosts would certainly punish them. Concerning the liars, the prophet wrote: “And they bend their tongues like their bow for lies: but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth; for they proceed from evil to evil, and they know not me, saith the Lord…And they will deceive everyone his neighbour, and will not speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies, and weary themselves to commit iniquity…” – Jeremiah 9: 3-9.
        Dangerous Rumours
        By a mischievous use of the tongue some have inflamed the passions of others and led them into war resulting in the loss of thousands of souls. The misuse of the tongues of men has caused separation between brothers, sisters and friends, and has also led to the breaking of matrimonial homes.
        There are good reasons why governments do not tolerate spreading of false rurnours. In a broadcast to the nation on national security in July, 1967, the Nigerian Inspector-General of Police, Alhaji Kam Selem, said: “Do not assist in spreading false and dangerous rumours. Report all peddlers of such rumours and all acts of intimidation and threat to the Police at once.” This is so because false rumours, being an abuse of the tongue, are dangerous and can lead to death.
        People who cannot bridle their tongues but will go about opening their mouths wide in lying and in loose talks must get into trouble. David the prophet, knowing the danger of a bad use of the tongue and how unruly it is, said that he would be careful in what he did so that he might not sin with his tongue, and that he would keep his mouth with a bridle. (Psalm 39:1) “Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue,” said King Solomon, “keepeth his soul from troubles.” – Proverbs 21: 23.
        To use the tongue to backbite or slander or in any other evil way against people is wickedness. It is never well with those who engage in such bad things. David, in his prayer to the Almighty God, said: “Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the insurrection of the workers: of iniquity: who whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their bows to shoot their arrows, even bitter words: that they may shoot in secret at the perfect… They .encourage themselves in an evil matter: they commune of laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them?…But ‘God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly shall they the wounded…” – Psalm 64: 2-9.
        These things are happening in our time. It is the understanding of this wonderful knowledge of the Bible that sometimes make us of the GKS pay deaf ears to the reproaches, abuses or revilings and misrepresentations of our detractors. Despite their machinations and slander, the Lord’s work continues to flourish, by His grace, while, spiritually, they are dwindling. We do not wish them evil; rather we pray that they should repent so that God may forgive them. But if they will not repent, God’s punishment for slanderers awaits them. – Psalm 50: 19-23.
        Grave Consequences
        We must seize this opportunity to warn people against using their tongues in uttering blasphemies. For irreverent talks about God and sacred things will but incur grave consequences which they cannot stand or bear. The tongue must not be used in any evil way. “Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.” (Proverbs 18: 21).
        And Jesus Christ declared: “…Every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment. For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.” – Matthew 12: 36, 37.
        James the apostle of Christ gave an intelligible description of the tongue, showing how hard it is to control and the fruits of it. He stated: “For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body…Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth. Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasted great things. Behold, how great matter a little fire kindleth! And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.” – James 3: 2-6.
        The apostle went on: “For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind: but the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison. Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God. Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be…Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.” – James 3: 7-13.
        The Lip of Truth
        Although the tongue is difficult to control, Christians must endeavour to use theirs properly. St. James himself also said: “If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man’s religion is vain.” – James 1: 26.
        If we can learn to use our tongue aright the Lord will bless us and we will also command the respect of responsible people in society. We should use our tongues in confessing or in preaching the truth of God’s word in order to impart His saving knowledge to others; to sing praises to God and glorify His holy name. (Psalm 35: 28; 71: 15-19,23, 24) We can use our tongues to condemn evil, to expose lies, and to comfort the afflicted and exhort the feeble minded ones. Solomon also said: “There is that speaketh like the piercing of a sword: but the tongue of the wise is health. The lip of truth shall be established forever: but a lying tongue is but for a moment.” – Proverbs 12: 18, 19; see also Proverbs 15:4; 17:20.
        Finally, let us always beat in mind St. Peter’s admonition, to wit: “For be that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile: let him eschew evil, and do good: let him seek peace, and ensue it.” – 1 Peter 3: 10, 11.`,

        content:`OWING to the frail nature of men, which always makes them seek supernatural aid, they are easily influenced by beliefs most of which are misguided. One of such beliefs, which the devil has been using to hoodwink or mislead men, is born out of the idea that death is merely a change from a lower to a higher plane of existence.
        The belief that “the human personality continues to exist after death, and that it is possible for living persons to communicate with those who have died”, is ancient and very wide spread.
        In various parts of the world there are people who claim to have special powers by which they hold intercourse with the dead; they are known as spiritualists. And today, believers in spiritism hold to it as a sort of religion, a science and a philosophy.
        It is believed that a spiritualist can be a medium (which means a “go-between”) through whom “the souls or spirits of dead persons” can send messages to living persons. Under the heading of SPIRITUALISM, the Illustrated World Encyclopaedia (volume 18) has this, among other things, to say: “Usually spiritualists assemble in a meeting called a seance. The medium goes into a trance or deep sleep. During this trance, the spirit of the dead person supposedly enters the medium’s body and talks to living persons, or gives signs by knocking on tables or in some other way.”
        Superstition
        Many of the fears to which men have been subjected are either the figments of imagination or the devices of the devil aimed at alienating mankind from the purpose of God. One can but agree to a large extent with David Hume, a British philosopher, in his conclusion that “weakness, fear, melancholy, together with ignorance, are the true sources of Superstition”.
        Among many African tribes as well as some other nations, it is generally believed that as soon as a person dies he assumes supernatural powers which he can exercise – for good or evil – over the living. Hence there is the threatening statement by some people: “If you don’t help me, I’ll haunt you after my death.” There are people who worship their dead parents and pray to the dead to bless them with the good things of life even though they know that their parents in their life time; lived in abject poverty.
        Some who claim to be Christians share some of these wrong beliefs and practices. When certain Galatians Christians turned to heathenish rites in the days of St. Paul, he warned: “Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods. But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage?” – Galatians 4:8, 9.
        Dead Fathers
        When some people find themselves in certain unfavourable circumstances, they develop a bad state of mind, and fear even their own shadows. For this reason they are prone to believe everything which seems to give them temporary relief or false hope and they seek aid from witch doctors, magicians, dead fathers or relations and so forth.
        There is a story of someone who was said to have struck a bargain with a spiritualist so that he could talk with his dead father. The spiritualist assured him that it was quite possible and that the venue would be at a burial ground. The man, as the story went, paid a handsome sum of money to the spiritualist. On the appointed day, both of them went to the burial ground where another fake posing to be the “dead father” had earlier gone into hiding. And it was about midnight. As soon as they arrived at the cemetery, and of course, the spiritualist having recited some incantations, the fake dressed in white flowing robes emerged with a cane. The man was so frightened that he was trembling as the whole thing looked like a nightmare to him. Worse still, his so called father came close to him and started to administer severe strokes of the cane on him. He screamed and ran away under agonising pain without getting his “father’s” advice. The spiritualist blamed the failure of the mission on him for being unable to bear the strokes of the cane which were a prelude to the blessing the “father” would have bestowed upon him.
        It is the stupid and simple folks that enrich the purses of quacks. The Illustrated World Encyclopaedia states: “Many people honestly believe in spiritualism. Unfortunately, there have been many professional magicians and others who use trickery to make themselves appear to be mediums.” (Emphasis ours)
        “Surely Die”
        Now, turning to the Holy Bible the belief that “the human personality continues to exist after death” and that there can be communication between the living and the dead, is without foundation; it is devilish, and true Christians discard it.
        God commanded Adam in the Garden of Eden that he must not eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, “for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.” (Genesis 2: 17) It is quite clear that to “surely die” means to cease to exist, pure and simple. But Satan, in his characteristic opposition to God, went subtly to Eve, Adam’s wife, in the guise of a serpent and deceived her saying: “Ye shall not surely die”. This was a blatant lie which gave “the mother of all living” a false hope and led her to sin.
        Concerning the devil, Jesus Christ said: “When he (Satan) speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own; for he is a liar, and the father of it.” (John 8: 44) In his efforts to sustain his lie, the devil whose disposition for deceit had earned him the notorious title of SERPENT, has been influencing the thoughts of men into thinking and believing that when a man dies, he is not completely dead. Also to this end, he with the assistance of the demons has been working in men to event unfounded dogmas and warped notions about the dead, and to inspire bad dreams, false visions, hallucinations, and such like.
        The truth of the Bible is that when a man dies, (the breath of life having left him) he is completely out of existence. He does NOT take any other form or shape nor does he go anywhere to live. He is absolutely unconscious and is turned to nothing: “Vanity of vanities,” said the Preacher, “all is vanity.” The next stage according to God’s promise is RESURRECTION – and then the dead rose shall be judged. Said St. Paul: “And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment.” – Hebrews 9: 27.
        Abel
        Some people sometimes refer to St. Paul’s statement about Abel at Hebrews 11: 4, that “he (Abel) being dead yet speaketh”. This does not mean that Abel was talking after his death. Rather the apostle was explaining how by Abel’s illustrious example of faith, which made him offer a better sacrifice than Cain, he is being spoken of up till today as a righteous man to teach people about faith in God and the doing of things that are pleasing in His sight. The paraphrased epistles, LIVING LETTERS, by Kenneth N. Taylor, renders the text thus: “It was by faith that Abel obeyed God and brought an offering that pleased God more than Cain’s offering did. God accepted Abel and proved it by accepting his gift; and though Abel is long dead, we can still learn from him about trusting God.”
        Witch of Endor
        Another account in the Bible often cited by certain people to show that the living can talk with the dead is the story at 1 Samuel 28: 3-25, about King Saul and the witch of Endor. At that time, Samuel the prophet was dead and had been buried in Ramah, his own city. And Saul the King drove out of the land all the witches and wizards.
        But Saul because of his unfaithfulness was not in favour with God and the Philistines had marshalled their forces and were set to war against Israel. As Saul saw the host of the enemies, he was troubled in heart for fear. And when he enquired of the Lord there was no answer, “neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets”. It was in this desperate state that Saul went to consult a witch. Shame to him! In order that he might not be recognised by the witch who was one of those ousted from Israel, he had to disguise himself by changing his royal robes. He went to the woman in the night – yes, the dark night is most suitable for this sort of dirty, shameful and ungodly business.
        Saul requested her to use her witchcraft power to bring up Samuel so that he might consult the dead prophet in regard to the war of the Philistines. When the woman under demoniacal influence divined, Samuel who was purported to have been raised was not seen by Saul. What he did was to ask the witch: “For what sawest thou?’. And she answered: “I saw gods ascending out of the earth.” (Verse 13) The dialogue continued. “And he said unto her, what form is he of? And she said, an old man cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and bowed himself.” (Verse 14)
        It does not even require a specialised knowledge of the Bible for any clear headed person to know from the narrative that the whole affair was under the command of an enemy of God – Satan the devil. In the first place, Saul himself testified, “God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams.” (Verse 15) And secondly, by going to consult a witch he was contravening the law of God which said: “Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the Lord your God.” – Leviticus 19: 31; see also Deuteronomy 18: 9-12.
        Devil’s Tricks
        Moreover, Saul did not see the so- called Samuel; he merely “PERCEIVED” from the woman’s description that it was he. And the witch herself said that she saw “gods”. How could Samuel alone turn to be gods? There lie the tricks of the devil, which are frequently manifested in the works of sorcerers and all kinds of demon possessed characters.
        The fact is that it was not Samuel that came up but demons that put up the appearance of an old man like Samuel. They are also known as “seducing spirits”, and it is they that impersonate the dead and make appearances or sounds that are seen or heard by spiritualists. St. Paul stated that Satan as well as his visible and invisible agents could change himself into an angel of light but that in the end all of them would get every bit of punishment their wicked deeds deserved. – 2 Corinthians 11: 13-15; see also 1 Timothy 4: 1; Revelation 16: 13, 14.
        Since it was made clear that God had forsaken Saul and refused to answer to his inquiries either “by dreams or by prophets”, there is no ground, therefore, to believe that Samuel, a faithful prophet of God who was already dead, could come back to be a party to the sins of the apostate Saul.
        By the way, why is it that any communication between the living and the dead is never through any genuine prophet of God but through witches, wizards, occultists and what have you? The plain truth is that the idea or practice did not originate from God. And the Lord warned: “And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and mutter: should not a people seek unto their God? for the living to the dead? To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word (God’s word), it is because there is no light in them.” – Isaiah. 8:19, 20.
        Christian Hope
        To show that the dead are absolutely unconscious and that they cannot be in communion with the living, the Psalmist declared: “For in death there is no remembrance of Thee (God): in the grave who shall give Thee thanks?” “Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help. His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.” – Psalm 6:5; 146:3, 4; see also Psalm 30: 9; Isaiah 38: 18, 19.
        What is more, King Solomon stated: “For the living know that they shall die; but the dead know not anything, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten. Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished…whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.” – Ecclesiastes 9: 5-6, 10.
        We advise you, dear reader, not to go to those people who are parading themselves as diviners or spiritualists when you are in trouble or in need of anything. Please, turn to God Almighty and pray to Him. If you earnestly pray with faith, and exercise patience, God the Merciful and Gracious Father will certainly grant you the desire of your heart. (Proverb 10: 24; Matthew 21: 22; Philippians 4: 6) God Himself said:
                                   “Look unto me, and be ye saved,
                                       all the ends of the earth:  for
                                         I am God, and there is none
                                               else.”- Isaiah 45: 22.
        
        On the whole, the highlight of the Christian hope about the dead is the consoling, divine promise of resurrection. And until the resurrection takes place the dead must remain silent and unconscious in the grave, and no one living can talk with them. Read Job. 14: 13-15; Psalm 115: 17; John 5: 28, 29.`, 
        title:"CAN THE LIVING TALK WITH THE DEAD?"},
     {key:14, 
        content:`THE Most High God having purposed to distinguish His people who worshipped Him from those who did not, instituted circumcision as a token of the covenant between Him and Abraham – the father of the Jewish nation. In process of time the gentile nations made in inroad into this erstwhile exclusive custom of the Jews and corrupted it. And so, Christianity, which is practised by spiritual Jews, does not lay emphasis on the physical circumcision but on the spiritual one.
        Circumcision is the act of cut- ting off the foreskin of a man. It is a practice which the Almighty God enjoined upon Abraham and his descendants. The rule was that a male child should be circumcised when he was eight days old. To Abraham, God said: “This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised. And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you. And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations…” – Genesis 17: 10-12.
        God was so strict about it that He ruled that every uncircumcised male child should be cut off from his people for having broken His covenant. – Genesis 17: 14.
        On the selfsame day that God spoke to Abraham, he took Ishmael, his son, who was 13 years old and all other males in his house- hold and circumcised them. Also, he, who was then 99 years old, had himself circumcised in obedience to the Lord’s instruction. – Genesis 17: 23-27.
        Since that time of Abraham, circumcision has not only become a necessary condition of Jewish nationality but also an act in which the Hebrews take particular glory. When Jesus Christ was born, he too was circumcised the eighth day. (Luke 2: 21) Other nations whose males were not circumcised were regarded by the Jews as unclean people otherwise known as the gentiles. Thus uncircumcision became synonymous, by implication, with heathenism, paganism or infidelity.
        Women Circumcision
        As time went on, certain other nations borrowed the Jewish custom of circumcision and so corrupted it that even their women were circumcised contrary to God’s ordinance.
        In this country, it is a common practice among certain ethnic groups or tribes to circumcise their female children. Some do it at a very early age and others circumcise their daughters at their adolescence or when they have attained their majority. So, the custom varies from tribe to tribe.
        There are some tribes that attach more importance to the circumcision of women than they attach to that of men. They have a set time when girls who have attained a certain standard of age are circumcised every year. It is an occasion that is associated with heathenish ceremonies including the worship of ancestors and the appeasing of the “gods” by way of offering sacrifices so that any danger may be averted during the circumcision of the girls.
        At this time whole towns are set in festive mood. The rich parents spend more than enough on the circumcision of their daughters only to demonstrate that the families are well-to-do. Some poor parents have to owe debts in order to make sure that their families, too, ‘do not fall below the average mark. On the part of the husbands of some of the circumcised girls, they also make a show of their affluence – which is to be assessed by the number of pieces of cloths, blouses, headdresses, chemise, shoes, trinkets of jewels, gold or silver, cosmetics, utensils and everything else one can think of for the use of women. Extravagance is even too mild a word fit to be used in describing what the people do on that occasion.
        But on the whole, what do they gain? Nothing, but vainglory! No wonder that some families are gripped with sorrow because of financial entanglements after all the hilarious enjoyments.
        There is a common belief among some of the pagans that a woman cannot be productive except she is circumcised. This springs from superstition, and it is a lie. It accounts for the fanaticism with which some people hold to the tradition of women circumcision, and it is because of this belief they regard those who oppose the practice as potential foes.
        Dangerous
        We must say that the circumcision of women is dangerous and very unscriptural. As a result of it some people had untimely lost their daughters or had they deformed for life. It is an unnecessary exercise which medical experts have advised against.
        In the issue of July 20, 1960, of the defunct Nigerian Daily Service, the “Daily Service Doctor” stated: “Chinyere is a thirteen-day-old child. A few days ago she was brought into my hospital by the parents who were all shouting and crying at the same time as this was their first child. The child was bleeding…What are the facts of the case? Twelve days after the birth of the child, the parents took her to an old woman to be circumcised. The old woman performed her ‘crude- surgery’ and immediately after the operation the child began to bleed heavily. They had to rush the child to me and but for a timely action on my part, the child would have died of haemorrhage.”
        The doctor was writing under the caption, “CIRCUMCISION IS DANGEROUS”. After outlining some biological aspects of women, which make their circumcision dangerous, he concluded: “Female circumcision is therefore unnecessary…It is about time our people stop this primitive female circumcision.” (Emphasis ours)
        Recently, the nursing sister in a Lagos Hospital strongly advised against female circumcision. She described clearly what circumcision in female consists of, and went on to show the complications involved in it. She made it known that “it might result in some gynecological conditions later on in life” She further stated: “I think nature should not be interfered with in this respect. The public in general should be educated on this subject and the ethnic and religious groups who indulge in this practice should be educated on this subject and discouraged from performing this operation in females,” (Sunday Times, November, 17, 1968,)
        Experience and events do justify these medical views, There was a case of a girl who turned neither man nor woman after circumcision, The matter was reported to have been investigated by the Criminal Investigation Department of the Nigerian Police, Warri, and taken to the Magistrate’s Court where a charge of “negligent act causing harm” to a girl was preferred against an old woman, This was published in the front page of the Mid- West Echo, issue of Tuesday, June 21, 1960, The newspaper reported: “Medical examination performed by the medical officer in charge of the Warri General Hospital claimed that ??? has been rendered sexless, due to what the doctor described as ‘mal-circumcision’,” (Ellipsis ours)
        It is sad to note that some people who call themselves Christians do not only subscribe to the idea of women circumcision but do put it into practice, No one can show from the Bible that God’s people ever circumcised a woman, When God instituted circumcision as earlier explained in this sermon, He did not include women. He told Abraham: “Every MAN child (not woman child) among you shall be circumcised,” – Genesis 17: 10.
        The argument of some that circumcision is a custom of the people does not justify the practice. The laws of God transcend all man-made customs or traditions. There- fore any custom that is contrary to the will of God must be thrown away by true Christians. God’s people are warned against heathenish customs. – Jeremiah 10: 2,3.
        Heart Circumcision
        Right from the time of Moses the prophet, God indicated that though the Jews were circumcised in the flesh, there was need yet for them to be circumcised in their hearts so that they might truly “love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live”. – Deuteronomy 10: 16; 30: 6.
        In the days of the early apostles of Jesus Christ, the question of circumcision aroused considerable controversy when certain Judaising teachers said to the gentle converts, “Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved”. To all intents and purposes, this teaching was subversive of genuine Christianity, and so Paul and Barnabas disputed and opposed it. – Acts 15: 1-5.
        When the matter was discussed in the assembly of the apostles and the elders of the Church at Jerusalem, the decision was reached that it was not necessary for the gentile converts to observe the rite of circumcision. – Acts 15: 6, 22-29.
        We must at this juncture stress that in the Christian era, the circumcision of the flesh is of no spiritual significance. Since the advent of Christianity when the way of salvation was opened to the gentiles, the lit era circumcision ceased to be a mark of distinction by which Abraham’s spiritual children are to be identified. What is important now is the spiritual circumcision which is a true conversion of the heart, faith in God and the keeping of His commandments.
        St. Paul stated: “For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision ….. For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh: but he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.” – Romans 2: 25-29.
        Faith
        Today, there are many people that have been circumcised in the flesh – both among the natural Jews and non-Jews alike – who do not believe in Christianity nor have faith in God. Such ones are not spiritually circumcised and they cannot be saved. On this score, St. Paul declared: “Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.” “For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision: but faith which worketh by love.”– 1 Corinthians 7: 19; Galatians 5: 2-3,6; 6: 12-16.
        We can understand, therefore, that neither circumcision in the flesh nor uncircumcision has anything to do with our salvation. It is a person who repents of his sins, fears God and serves Him with faith in the true church organisation, which preaches the truth of Christ unadulteratedly, that is spiritually circumcised; and it is such that will obtain life eternal in God’s Kingdom of end- less bliss. Said St. Paul: “For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh.” (Philippians 3: 3) Furthermore, he exhorted the Christians to be constant in the faith of Christ, and added: “In whom (Christ) also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ.” – Colossians 2: 11.
        In closing, we exhort you to be truly circumcised in your hearts so that you may worship the Lord in truth. It does not matter which nation or race or tribe you hail from, because God is no respecter of persons. In every nation he that fears Him and does His will is accepted by Him. – Acts 10: 34, 35: Romans 4: 9-12.
        May the Lord bless His upon your hearts. Amen.`,

        content:`THE date of the birth of Jesus would not have been a subject of controversy if the churches of Christendom had been consistent in telling their adherents the truth of the matter. That Christmas is a pagan festival with an unseemly Christian veneer or covering is a glaring fact of the Scripture and history.
        In The Explanatory Catechism of Christian Doctrine, it is stated in answer to Questions 50 and 51, that our Saviour Jesus Christ was born at Bethlehem on Christmas Day, the 25th of December. But how the churches came about this date, no one cares to ask. The erroneous belief that the priests and catechists cannot lie makes the churchgoers accept this teaching with quiet contentment. The people therefore go all out to celebrate Christmas NOT out of a scripturally grounded faith but because they so were bred. 
        A true Christian does not do a thing simply because the whole world or majority esteem it highly and do it. Before he does anything, he must first of all satisfy himself that it is in accord with the will of God as revealed in the Holy Scripture. Christ himself said: “…For that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.” – Luke 16: 15. 
        After a diligent research into both sacred and profane history, we have no doubt in our minds that Jesus Christ was born in the month of October, and NOT in December!
        We must at this stage point out that the day, month or year in which Christ was born is not positively stated chapter and verse in the Bible for the unlearned or those who do not search the Scriptures to understand. But there are scriptural records including the Bible Chronology from which we can show to those with open minds that his birth took place in October. 
        Bible Account
        In those days there were appointed 24 Jewish priests, the sons of Aaron, to serve in the temple in a year. Everyone officiated according to the order of his course or turn – two every month. The first priest served from the beginning of the first month called Nisan or Abib and retired at the middle of the month; and the second took over from the middle to the end of the month. The priest Abijah served in the eighth course according to 1 Chronicles 24: 1-10. The eighth course started from the middle to the end of the fourth month known as Tammuz, which, according to the Jewish Calendar, corresponds with the latter part of our June to early July. (Vide The Oxford Encyclopedic Concordance, page 197, and The Universal Bible Dictionary by Buckland & Williams, page 475.) 
        Zacharias, the father of John the Baptist, was a successor of Abijah. It was when he was officiating in the temple in the order of his turn – “the course of Abijah” – that an angel of God appeared to him saying that his wife, Elizabeth, would bear him a son to be named John. (Luke 1: 5-13) After the completion of Zacharias’ period of duty in early July (Tammuz), his wife became pregnant, and she hid herself for five months. – Luke 1: 23, 24. 
        In the sixth month of Elizabeth’s conception – Chisleu, which is our December – the angel Gabriel was sent by God to the virgin Mary and he announced to her that she would conceive and bear a son to be called JESUS. The angel added:  “And behold, thy cousin, Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren. For with God nothing shall be impossible.” – Luke 1: 26-31,36,37. 
        Consequent upon the annunciation Mary, no doubt, was in high spirits. With haste she went straight to a city in the uplands of Judah to meet Elizabeth. She stayed with her cousin about three months (i.e. from January to March) and then returned home. (Luke 1: 39-40, 56) Something dramatic occurred when Mary visited Elizabeth. As soon as she entered Zacharias’ house and greeted Elizabeth, the babe (John) stirred in her womb. The words of Elizabeth to Mary at that instance, which were motivated by the Holy Spirit, show clearly that Mary herself was already pregnant. Not only did Elizabeth bless the fruit of her womb but she went on to address her out right as “the mother of my Lord”. – Luke 1: 41-44. 
        According to medical authorities the span of foetal life under normal condition is 280 days, which is nine months; any time in the tenth month the child, by God’s grace, can be born. This was the case with John the Baptist. The angel appeared to Mary in the sixth month of Elizabeth’s conception and Mary went to her and stayed three months: six plus three equal nine. It was then “Elisabeth’s full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son” – obviously, in the tenth month, April. – Luke 1: 36,56-57. 
        Having been equipped with this knowledge, let us now count Mary’s conception from that January as was manifest in Elizabeth’s declaration, we will arrive at September as the ninth month; then in the tenth month OCTOBER, Jesus Christ was born. But on which day in October his birth took place no one can tell because there is no record. We of the GKS say only what we can prove. 
        With regard to the year of Christ’s birth, historians disagree with one another. Some hold to B.C. 2 or B. C. 4, and others suggest B.C. 6. We are no historians, and so we do not wish to be entangled in their disagreements. But from a scrutiny of historical records B.C. 2 is more acceptable to many. 
        Physical Facts
        The physical features of Palestine in regard to the climate lend support to the view that Christ was not born in December. According to the Gospel story, there were shepherds attending their flocks in the open fields by night when Christ was born. This could not have been possible in December, because all accredited authorities agree that December, which corresponds with the Jewish ninth month, Chisleu, (Zechariah 7: 1) was usually a time of winter in Palestine when the people could not stay outside in the night owing to the intense cold. The Oxford Encyclopedic Concordance states that there: was “snow on the mountains”. 
        But October is the Jewish seventh month called Tisri or Ethanim. (1 Kings 8: 2) It was a time of normal weather that permitted of outdoor or outside activities.  Again, the fact that the churches of Christendom observe the death of Jesus Christ (“Good Friday”) in April, confirms that his birth could not have taken place in December. Of a truth, he was killed in April, which is Nisan or Abib, the first month of the Jewish year, when the Feast of Passover or Unleavened Bread was celebrated. 
        We all agree that Jesus Christ lived for 33 1/2 years. Now let us admit that he was born in December as the churches teach, it will mean, therefore, that his 33rd birthday anniversary fell on December, and six months later, which was June, he died. If it was so, why then are the churches celebrating his death in April and not in June? The plain truth is that he was born in October. His 33rd birthday then fell on October, and six months later, that is, in April, he was slain. 
        Historical Facts
        There is no authentic history in existence that gives support to the teaching that Jesus Christ was born in December. We challenge anyone who may argue this to cite a SINGLE authority to the contrary to prove us wrong. There was no such festival as Christmas until the fourth century, and it was the Romish Church in its characteristic tendency of “meeting Paganism half-way”, that just fixed on December 25 as Christ’s birthday. We shall dwell on this point later on in this sermon. 
        Earl W. Count, in his book, 4000 Years of Christmas, stated that “December twentyfifth is no more the historical date of His (Christ’s) birth than is any other”. He added: “The Christians chose it to be His birthday only several centuries after he had lived and died.” (Page 34).
        We cannot do without making reference to the evidence of the well-known ecclesiastical historian, Alexander Hislop. In his distinguished work, The Two Babylons, he wrote: “There is not a word in the Scriptures about the precise day of His (Christ’s) birth…What is recorded there, implies that at what time soever His birth took place, it could not have been on the 25th of December… The cold of the night, from December to February, is very piercing, and it was not the custom for the shepherds of Judea to watch their flocks in the open fields later than about the end of October. It is in the last degree incredible, then, that the birth of Christ could have taken place at the end of December.” (Pages 91-92, emphasis ours) 
        On this point there is great unanimity among commentators who include Barnes, Doddridge, Lightfoot, Joseph Scaliger, Joseph Mede, and Jennings, in his Jewish Antiquities. After a comprehensive disquisition on the subject, among other argument, Joseph Mede adduced the following: “At the birth of Christ every woman and child was to go to be taxed at the city whereto they belonged, whither some had long journeys; but the middle of winter was not fitting for such a business especially for women with child, and children to travel in. Therefore, Christ could not be born in the depth of winter…”(MEDE’S Works, 1672). 
        Hislop also quoted Gill as stating in his Commentary on Luke 2: 8 thus: “The first rain falls in the month Marchesvan, which answers to the latter part of our October and the former part of November…From whence it appears that Christ must be born before the middle of October, since the first rain was not yet come.” (The Two Babylons, pages 91-92).
        “No date is more unlikely for the birth of Christ than the twenty-fifth of December; but it was the birthday of Mithra…” This was stated by E. E. Kellett in his A Short History of Religions. And Professor Cecil John Cadoux, M.A., D.D., D.Litt. Professor” of Church History at Mansfield College, in his book The Life of Jesus, wrote: “There are no grounds for thinking that He (Jesus) was born in December.” 
        Furthermore, the Illustrated World Encyclopedia has this to say: “Our calendar, by which we reckon the days, months, and years, is dated from the first year after the birth of Jesus. We call this the Christian Era. But as we study and read, we will learn that  Jesus was not really born on the 25th of December…” (Vol. 5, page 1194).
        Roman Catholic Confession
        It is heartening to note that at long last both the Roman Catholic and Protestant Churches of Christendom have openly admitted that Jesus Christ was not actually born on the 25th of December. It can be recalled that for this veracious view on which the God’s Kingdom Society took her stand since her inception, he has been subjected to persecutions of one sort or another. 
        Concerning the date of Christ’s birth, The Catholic Voice of December 1956, has the following to say: “The 25th. Dec., the present feast of Christmas has a longstanding tradition, but it is likely that in the beginning it was simply fixed on one of the great public holidays of the civil year and probably one that was originally a pagan feast”! (Page 179-180, emphasis ours).
        In answer to a question as to how the Roman Catholics managed to know from Holy Scripture that Jesus was born on December 25th, The Catholic Voice, issue of July 1962, states: “The Gospels do not mention any date for the birth of Christ. We do not know the date of Christ’s birth, not even the year in which He was born,” (Emphasis ours) But may we pause to ask: If they do not know the date of Christ’s birth, why do they categorically and dogmatically state in the Catechism and other books that Jesus Christ was born on December 25? Is this not inconsistency? The Catholic Voice continues, “We celebrate the feast of Christ’s birth on the 25th of December, at least in the Western Church. The Eastern Catholic Church celebrates the same feast on the 6th of January. These dates are not based on historical evidence of the exact date of Christ’s birth…” (Emphasis ours) 
        Protestant Admission
        The following piece extracted from “A Christmas Sermon” by a Protestant Pastor, which was published in the African Challenge of December 1959, speaks for itself: .. Was Jesus born on December 25? In fairness to the critics who ask this question, it must be admitted that although we know the year” (unlike the Roman Catholics that do not know the year) “the exact day of the birth of the Lord Jesus Christ is not known…Long before Christ was born, December 25 had been the time for a noisy pagan festival in honour of the god of the sun, In time, however, the Church substituted Christmas for the old pagan festival with the view of turning the minds of the heathen to the true living God” 
        The reason of the Church for changing the date of Christ’s birth, as given by the Pastor, is flimsy. It is not by changing the birthday of Christ to that day of a pagan carnival that would win people to Christ. Rather it would lead to more ungodliness, and that is why up till today Christmas is still; defaced with pagan marks.
        Christmas is Paganism
        “That Christmas was originally a Pagan festival is beyond all doubt,” stated Alexander Hislop. “The time of the year, and the ceremonies with which it is still celebrated, prove its origin,” he added. (The Two Babylons, page 93) Concerning Christmas, E. E. Kellett wrote: “No one can doubt that it has many pagan characters; and indeed this is why it was totally rejected by some Dissenting Churches.” (A Short History of Religions). 
        The GKS has always held that there is nothing in the celebration of Christmas that reflects the teaching or character of Jesus Christ, or portrays the glory of God. The “Christmas Editorial” of the African Challenge of December 1959, vindicates our view. It states in part: “Christ, the matchless Saviour of mankind, would undoubtedly be grieved by the way the world celebrates His traditional birthday. The world as well as those who are Christians by name celebrate Christmas with great jubilation at the expense of worship…The Christmas season is increasingly becoming a time for most business people to make more money. The most profitable season of the year for nearly all shops is the Christmas season, when the public is enticed: ‘Do your Christmas shopping early!’ Another thing that robs us of the meaning of Christmas is traditionalism… Do not some even join pagan customs with their Christmas celebrations?” Please let people ponder these things and stop deceiving themselves.
        If there is any season when the Police at most have a restless time in the year, it is the Christmas season. If there is any period when more cases of crimes, accidents and deaths are reported in the year, it is the same notorious Christmas season. 
        The acts of lawlessness and hooliganism that always characterize its celebration are but sure proofs that it is an unchristian affair. It is a time when people eat and drink in excess. Some disfigure themselves with all sorts of masks, carry about dreadful images and others paint their faces and run amok like crazy people to do havoc and disturb the peace of responsible people. How can the Christian mind imagine that all these abominations are done to honour the Son of God, Jesus Christ the Righteous who is the Prince of Peace? It is unthinkable!
        This sermon does not warn you against celebrating the birthday of Christ at the spiritually appropriate time and in a Christian manner to the glory of God. St. Paul advised that God should be served in the way acceptable to Him. – Hebrews 12: 28. 
        
        The vanity of Christmas has been exposed enough. History condemns it. The Holy Bible, which is the law book and guide for all true Christians, does not justify it. A word is enough for the wise.  And Christ says, “He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.”`, 
        title:"WAS CHRIST BORN ON CHRISTMAS DAY?"},
     {key:16, 
        content:`ONE of the most important festivals that God ordained for His true worshippers to celebrate in this age of international distress and perplexity, the Last Day, is the Feast of Tabernacles. Yet it is the one most of those who profess to be Christians treat with utmost neglect.
        The Feast of Tabernacles is an annual festival that was instituted by the Almighty God since the days of Moses the prophet during the historic journey of the Israelites from Egypt to Canaan. God’s instruction was to the effect that the feast should be celebrated on the 15th day of the seventh month of the Jewish year, and to last eight days. On that occasion the children of Israel were by law enjoined to make offerings to the Lord and to dwell in booths as a memorial of their experience in the wilderness when God made them live in booths under His protection. The ordinance concerning the feast is recorded at Leviticus 23: 33-43.
        God said: “Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto the Lord seven days: on the first day shall be a sabbath, and on the eighth day shall be a sabbath. And ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before the Lord your God seven days it shall be a statute for ever in your generations: ye shall celebrate it in the seventh month. Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites born shall dwell in booths: that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God.” – Leviticus 23: 39-43.
        Ingathering
        Furthermore, in Deuteronomy 16: 13-17, it is written: “Thou shalt observe the feast of tabernacles seven days, after that thou hast gathered in thy corn and thy wine: and thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite, the stranger, and the father- less, and the widow, that are with- in thy gates …and they shall not appear before the Lord empty: every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of the Lord thy God which he hath given thee.”
        No doubt, the Feast of Tabernacles was of great significance to the Jews. It was also known as the Feast of Ingathering for the fact that it was usually celebrated when they had gathered in their crops. – Exodus 23: 16; 34: 22.
        The reading of the law of God to the hearing and understanding of the people was a very important event in the celebration of the feast. This was so because of the sanctifying effect the law was capable of having on the Jews so “that they may learn, and fear the Lord your God”. – Deuteronomy 31: 10-13.
        When the Jews returned from Babylonish captivity and resettled in Canaan, there was an occasion when they gathered together and caused the book of the law of God to be read to the hearing of all of them. It was on the second day of that occasion when “the chief of the fathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levites” were assembled before Ezra, the scribe, so as to under- stand the words of the law, that they came across the ordinance of the Feast of Tabernacles. As it is written:
        “And they found written in the law which the Lord had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month: and that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth unto the mount, and fetch olive branches, and pine branches, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is written.”
        Following this discovery from the law book, the people went all out to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles with great jubilation. The grandeur of the occasion was tremendous, and the rejoicing of the celebrants was so much that Nehemiah recorded that “since the days of Jeshua (Joshua) the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so”. The prophet then stated: “And there was very great gladness. Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according unto the manner.”- Nehemiah 8: 14-18.
        Spiritual Jews
        Some people argue that the Feast of Tabernacles has nothing to do with Christianity and that it was meant for the Jews alone. They therefore ask whether we of the GKS are Jews.
        What many people do not know is the fact that there are spiritual Jews as there are natural Jews. The natural Jews are those who are Abraham’s children in the flesh – that is, by the circumstance of birth. They are supposed to be the worshippers of God like Abraham their fleshly father, but the pity of it is that some of them, today, neither believe in God nor in Jesus Christ as the Saviour. On the other hand, the spiritual Jews are those who become the children of Abraham by faith notwithstanding their place of birth or origin. In this Christian Era, it is the spiritual Jews – not those in the flesh – that are acknowledged as the “Israel of God” or the children of God. – Romans 9: 6-8; Galatians 6: 12-16.
        Said St. Paul: “For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh: but he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.” (Romans 2: 28, 29) He further said: “Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham…So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.” – Galatians 3: 7-9.
        Anyone who has a vivid understanding of the Scriptures as shown in the foregoing explanation, will not ask as to whether we are Jews. Indeed, we are spiritual Jews and so too are other persons who are of the Abrahamic faith and who worship God in truth as ordained by Him through Jesus Christ. In fact, anyone who is a true Christian is a spiritual Jew.
        Christ’s Participation
        It is of great interest to note that Jesus Christ, the Founder of Christianity, celebrated the Feast of Tabernacles and thus set the pace for his followers. The occasion afforded him a good opportunity to discharge his functions as a great teacher of truth- “a Minister of the Sanctuary, and of the true Tabernacle”. – Hebrew 8: 1, 2.
        The record of St. John about Christ’s participation in the celebration of the feast is as clear as it is fascinating. He stated that when the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles was close at hand, the brothers of Jesus Christ asked him to go to Judea for the feast so that his disciples might see his works. They portrayed him as one who sought to publicise himself and so they urged him derisively to go and “shew thyself to the world”. – John 7: 2-4.
        Some people ignorantly argue that those brothers of Jesus were his disciples. No, they were not. It is clearly written in verse 5 that “neither did his brethren believe in him”. They were his brothers in the flesh being the children of Mary.
        Jesus was a man with a mission and so he always took care to guard against the machinations of his enemies who hated him for exposing their evil deeds and whose desire was to make his mission a failure. Therefore, he told his brothers that the right time for him to go to the feast had not yet come. He added: “The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.” – Verses 6-8.
        After his brothers had gone to the feast, “then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as It were in secret”. This he did because the wicked Jews looked for a chance to kill him. But when the festival was half over, he no longer hid himself neither did he conceal his identity any more, rather he entered the temple and taught a vast multitude the doctrine of God. And when the Jews expressed astonishment at his learning and Intelligence, he declared: “My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me. – Verses 10-17.
        On the last and great day of the feast, Jesus Christ was very conspicuous in view of the active part he played. With great enthusiasm and earnestness, and in his characteristic convincing clearness, Christ directed a soul-saving message to all peoples of the earth. As it is written: “In the last day; that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink. He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.” – Verses 37, 38.
        From the foregoing, it is abundantly clear that Jesus Christ celebrated the Feast of Tabernacles, and it is nothing short of unfaithfulness, therefore, for any of his disciples to refrain from following the example of Our Lord and Saviour by celebrating the feast.
        Watchtower Society
        The controversy in regard to the Feast of Tabernacles sparked off by the members of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society in the forties is still fresh in our memory. They criticised the GKS for observing the feast and contended that Jesus Christ did not take part in its celebration. But in 1950, the “Jehovah’s witnesses” in Nigeria were covered with shame when the hierarchy of their organisation in the United States published an article captioned, “THE REAL FEAST OF INGATHERING UNDER WAY”, in the Watchtower magazine issue of July I, 1950.
        The Watchtower has the following to say: “The apostle John gives an account of Jesus’ attendance at the feast of tabernacles, and of the things he said and did, which leads us to the conclusion that this visit was a very important one; and so we find it to be in showing the importance of the feast of tabernacles … The reading of the law at the feast of tabernacles was for the instruction of the people. The religious leaders of the Jews were looking for Jesus at this time, to kill him. In view of this fact some might ask, why did Jesus expose himself publicly? He here began the fulfillment of this type. He was teaching the truth to those that would hear, thus showing them the way of life and happiness. There the type began to be fulfilled.”
        In spite of all this, the members of the Watchtower Society are still confused about the significance of the feast in our time!
        Prophetic Instruction
        Although the precedent set by Jesus Christ is enough to guide us Christians, there is a definite prophetic instruction to the effect that the worshippers of God in these last days in which we live should celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles. As it is written: “And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem (God’s Kingdom organization – Rev. 21: 2) shall even go up from year to year to worship the King, the Lord of hosts and to keep the feast of tabernacles. And it shall be, that whoso will not come up of all the families of the earth unto worship the King, the Lord of host, even upon them shall be no rain (rain means the Lord’s blessing). And if the family of Egypt (Egypt here means spiritually, the ungodly) go not up, and come not, that have no rain; there shall be the plague, wherewith the Lord  will smite the heathen that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.  This shall be the punishment of Egypt (the ungodly), and the punishment of all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.” – Zechariah 14: 16-19.
        This prophecy was not meant to fulfil in the days of the prophets of old but in this last days of this evil world when all nations irrespective of race, colour or tribe are called to worship the Almighty Father through Jesus Christ. But we must point out that Christians are not to observe the letters of the law but the spirit of it which gives life. (2 Corinthians 3: 5,6) In view of this, we are not bound to keep the feast in the seventh month but at any chosen time as the Lord’s spirit directs (and we observe it this year, December 15-22). And so too we do not make burnt offerings since Jesus Christ, the antitypical lamb, had been sacrificed for mankind once and for all. (John 1: 29; 1 Corinthians 5: 7; Hebrews 10: 5-12). However, we do offer spiritual sacrifice – “the sacrifice of praise to God” through the preaching of His word, giving of thanks and so forth.- Hebrew 13: 15.
        In the light of the scriptural authorities adduced in this sermon, readers who are unbiased and are of goodwill will appreciate why the God’s Kingdom Society celebrates the feast annually. And for keeping the feast commandment, we have always enjoyed with thanks, the blessings symbolized by rain which the Lord promised to pour upon the celebrants of the Feast of Tabernacles. – Zechariah 14: 16, 17; Ezekiel 34: 26; 1 John 3: 22.`,

        content:`AT this time that the year is rolling away, it is customary with people of sober minds and responsibility to make fresh resolutions aimed at guiding their actions, improving their habits and making the most of their lives in the New Year.
        On this score, the message of the President of God’s Kingdom society (GKS), Brother E. T. Otomewo, to the Churches of Christ during the celebration of the Christian Feast of Tabernacles, which ended last Sunday, is very timely indeed. The message captioned, Beware of What You Sow in Life, provides enough recipe for everyone who reckons with God in his life, to make good resolutions.
        Following is the full text of the message:
        Members and Friends,
        HAIL JEHOVAH AND CHRIST JESUS!
        As I stated in my Freedom Day Message in October this year – particularly in the interest of the non-members who joined us in fellowship – we of the GKS, as of faith, HAIL JEHOVAH AND CHRIST JESUS instead of mortal men because it is They alone that can truly protect and save. – Psalm 3: 8; Jeremiah 17: 5,7; Isaiah 45: 22; Daniel 3: 28, 29; Acts 4: 10-12; Revelation 7: 9, 10. Some hailed Hitler, the dictator, during World War II, believing that he was their saviour. But he was unable to save them and so Jeremiah 17: 5 which says, “Cursed is the man that trusteth in man” fulfilled to a great extent on his blind followers. In our human dealings, we can trust or repose confidence in men who are sincere, honest and GODLY but in so far as deliverance or salvation is concerned, it is God alone through Jesus Christ that we who are Christians should look to. This is why we HAIL JEHOVAH AND CHRIST JESUS!
        Why We Gather
        Earlier, notice was given that as from December 15-22, the GKS and other believers in Christ would celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles all over the world. We are therefore assembled here this day for this purpose – that is, to celebrate the Christian Feast of Tabernacles.
        Before dwelling on the subject of my Message for this occasion, let me just refresh your memories in short, of what the Feast is. It is a yearly festival ordained by Jehovah the Creator of the world. – Leviticus 23: 33-43. It is to be celebrated by every worshipper of God so that he may be protected and prospered. And the Jews did celebrate it as was ordained by God in those days.
        When Jesus Christ, the founder of Christianity, came he too celebrated it as an example for his disciples to follow, and that is why true Christians celebrate it today. – John 7: 1-18, 37, 38; 13: 15. And God had warned through Zechariah, His prophet, that the remnant of His people in this last day in which we live, should celebrate the Feast and that those who did not would be punished with plague. – Zechariah 14: 16-19. The foregoing scriptural authorities are clear enough, and they justify our celebrating the Feast of Tabernacles annually, by the grace of God.
        Whatever a Man Soweth He Shall Reap
        Now, let me turn to the topic of my message: “BEWARE OF WHAT YOU SOW IN LIFE”. There are some people who think that man is in this world to do just what he likes until he quits it at death without giving account of his doings to anyone in this wicked world or in the new world hereafter. They do not believe in the perfect world of God that will soon take the place of this world which is ridden with wickedness. Some of them do not believe in God too! Therefore, they do all sorts of things – good and bad – to their fellow men without care or fear. But by so doing they are sowing seeds which shall grow in to kindred crops or trees, and the fruits of which they shall reap in a DETERMINED TIME that is as certain as day and night. In Proverbs 11: 19, 21, God used Solomon to say:
        “As righteousness tendeth to life: so he that pursueth evil pursueth it to his own death. Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished: but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.”
        From the foregoing quote, it is clear that man, however powerful he may be, will certainly reap what he sows. And there are different ways we sow in this world. We sow by word of mouth and by our acts. If we say good things about God and His work, He takes note of them. He will bless us for so doing even now in this evil world, and fully and everlastingly in His perfect Kingdom of endless bliss. Those who do the opposite, He may punish now but more particularly in the age of the judgment of the dead.
        Moreover, men also sow by word of mouth when they say kindly or unkindly things about other people. Those whom they say them about, may not be able to bless them or take vengeance but their children, relations or even friends may do so and, above all; God who impartially -distributes His blessings among the faithful and also punishes the wicked justly, will certainly act in His own appointed time.
        In view of all this, reasonable and godly people know that by word of mouth and by action or deed-good or bad – they are sowing seeds which they – shall surely reap; and so they TAKE GREAT CARE in what they sow, that is, what they say or do to other people so that they may not reap the vengeance of ungodly men or that of God in the end. I say, “the vengeance of ungodly men” because it is the ungodly that revenge. No man is commissioned by God to take vengeance on his neighbour. The proper thing to do is to go to the law court, if one wishes, to seek redress. It is God alone that is to avenge and He Himself said, “Vengeance is mine.” – Romans 12: 19.
        Some people want to enjoy the good things of life at the expense of their neighbours. They steal from or cheat people to become rich; some acquire wealth, fame and power through oppression, mischief or some other forms of wickedness. In all this, such ones are sowing evil and will CERTAINLY REAP THE FRUITS THEREOF. Those who sow good will reap good and those who sow evil will reap evil. Yes, we shall reap WHATEVER we sow. As it is written:
        “Be not deceived; God is not mocked: FOR WHATSOEVER A MAN SOWETH, THAT SHALL HE ALSO REAP.” – Galatians 6: 7.
        Do not be carried away by your good status in life into talking carelessly and hurtfully to your neighbours. Do no harm to people by your acts. If you do, you shall reap the fruits thereof. You cannot run away from a mightier man than you, the Government of the day and, above all, God Himself, Who will make you EAT the bad fruits of what you sow!
        I said earlier that we should not hurt people by word of mouth. But if you are lawfully placed in a position, spiritual or otherwise to rebuke and even to punish an evil-doer as a measure of discipline, it is understandable, and it does not matter whether the offender’s or sinner’s feelings are hurt or not. God will be pleased, and God-fearing, law-abiding men will appreciate it.
        Haman and Jezebel
        Every wicked person knows that he is wicked. His conscience pricks him when he does evil. He will certainly reap what he sows. Jezebel and Haman are ready instances. Jezebe1 sowed kindred evil seeds – she killed Naboth, ruled her husband contrary to God’s law (Genenis 3: 16) and committed idolatry or spiritual fornication. Indeed, she reaped the fruit of her iniquity. She was thrown from a storey building down to death with her body dismembered; her spattered blood, dogs licked! What an in- glorious death for a queen! Yes, she reaped what she sowed. That was the reward of wickedness. – 1 Kings 21: 23, 24; 2 Kings 9: 30-37.
        Haman also reaped enough of what he sowed. He conspired to kill innocent Jews and set the gallows ready for Mordecai who refused to bow to him because of his faith in God and obedience to His laws. He, Haman, reaped the fruit of his actions. It was he that was hanged instead. – Esther chapter 7; see also Psalm 7: 15, 16.
        True Christians of today who know these things fear God and tremble at His word always. – Proverbs 16: 6; 1 Peter 3: 10-12.
        If the beginning of one’s life is good and prosperous, though by evil means, one should beware. The end may not be good with one. The beginning does not always dictate the end. There was the case of Thomas Paine, the agnostic. He was popular at a stage in his life but at the end he, like Jezebel and Haman, died an ignominious death – “practically deserted by his friends…broken-hearted, unnoticed, unrewarded and unsung”! – Vide the Morning Post, Tuesday, August 20, 1963. That was the end of a worldly intellectual who was an infidel that took pride in blasphemy by word of mouth, by’ his pen, and by conduct. He reaped partially, of course, the fruit of his ungodliness in this evil world. I know of no report that he repented anti served Jesus Christ before he died. He shall therefore be judged by God during the resurrection of the unjust for his opposition to God’s work. – Hebrews 9: 27; Acts 24: 15; Romans 14: 12; 2 Corinthians 5: 10.
        Exhortation
        Let us watch and guard against anything that will be detrimental to our end by sowing good seeds – either by word of mouth or by deeds – so that we may lead a life of contentment and reap peace, happiness and other good things from God in the end. But those who ignore this advice – whether they like it or not – will certainly reap the reward of their iniquities. As it is written:
        “Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.” –  Job 4: 8.
        Finally, I exhort you to support the work of God always by all means at your disposal – your influence, your money, your wisdom with which God has blessed you, your substance and/or possessions and even your body. In so doing, you are sowing righteousness or sowing “to the Spirit”, and you shall, by the grace and power of God, reap everlasting life in His perfect Kingdom as recorded in Galatians 6: 8. See also Proverbs 3: 9, 10.
        I also exhort you to prove yourselves at all times as true Christians in your dealings with your fellow men. Deal with one and sundry in love and be at peace with your neighbours always as recorded in Romans 12: 17 and 18, to wit:
        “Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men. If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.”
        May God be with us all until we meet again to celebrate the Feast in 1969 by His grace and power. And may the Feast of Tabernacles’ blessings parabolically called “rain” in Zechariah 14:16-19, be our portion forever. Amen.`,

        content:`“WHEN once ‘the love of money’ is allowed to rule in the heart, it becomes the prolific root of all kinds of evil. Every species of impiety, iniquity, and vice, in one way or another, grows from it; and a large proportion of the miseries, as well as the crimes of mankind, originates from the same source.” There is abundance of truth in this piece from Scott’s Commentary.
    
        We are living in a world where men are engrossed in the pursuit of materialism. Men’s minds are inspired with extravagant passion for wealth and there is over-estimation of money among people of almost all walks of life. It is therefore not uncommon to come across those who say, “I must either get rich at all costs or I die”. Such are the class of people St. Paul described as “men of corrupt minds, .and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness”. But he warned that we should keep away from them. – 1 Timothy 6: 5.
        Let us get it clear straight away that money in itself is not evil but the love of it is a sin.
        Bribery
        In this sermon we wish to expatiate on one of the evils that the love of money has caused to be instilled in the nerves of many people. It is an evil, though not peculiar to our country, that continues to pester our society in spite of public outcry against it. And what is it? BRIBERY!
        Bribery is a gift used corruptly to influence public or official action, or something offered to a person in order to persuade him to do a favour he ought not to do. It is a sin because it is a transgression of the law of God; and according to the laws of the land, it is a criminal offence. Anyone found guilty of it in the law court is exposed to a summary conviction. But then that does not free him from God’s own judgment and punishment EXCEPT he repents and STOPS taking bribes.
        A point we must make clear is that both the receiver and the giver of a bribe are guilty of sin before God. Concerning the judgment of God, Paul the apostle stated that it is not only those who commit sins that are worthy of death but those, too, who aid and abet or have pleasure in or applaud them. (Romans 1: 32) It was on the strength of this understanding he admonished Timothy, his workfellow in the gospel, not to “be partaker of other men’s sins” but to “keep thyself pure”. (1 Timothy 5: 22.) People should therefore refrain from giving or taking bribes.
        In the days of the civilian rule in Nigeria, the obnoxious odour of bribery and corruption stank to the high heavens. This diabolical practice was so widespread that from the office of messengers to that of high officials or the honourables were men who indulged heart and soul in it.
        
        The stage was reached that a young man or woman from college with a School Certificate could hardly get a job unless he or she gave a bribe. In some cases poor applicant girls were carnally defiled by immoral employers – a thing they would not want done to their daughters. The position was such that in most cases employment was not based on the merit of qualification but on the consideration of how much, in cash or kind, was corruptly offered.
        It is sad to note that some on a high scale of salary demand up to £10 or £20 from a poor man who is seeking employment as a “labourer”. Sadder still is the fact that some of these labourers are sacked after working for a space of about three months or so, in order that the heartless bribe-grabbers may create chance to get more bribes. This is to show how callous and avaricious some men are, but God will certainly hear the cry of the poor and needy and plead their cause, so “that the man of the earth may no more oppress”. Yes, “the expectation of the poor shall not perish forever”, and the unrepentant corrupt fellows who oppress and make things difficult for them will be uprooted by God. – Psalm 9: 17, 18; 10: 2-18.
        Anyone who, because of corrupt gain, denies another of his civic right to hold any public office for which he is in every respect qualified, is wicked. He will be justly recompensed by God. “Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished: but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.” – Proverbs 11: 21; see also Isaiah 3: 11.
        There is no record that God had ever dealt kindly with those who oppressed the poor; rather He punished them. Concerning the oppressors and bribe-mongers, God caused His prophet to write: “Forasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the poor, and ye take from him bur- dens of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink wine of them. For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins: THEY AFFLICT THE JUST, THEY TAKE A BRIBE, AND THEY TURN ASIDE THE POOR IN THE GATE FROM THEIR RIGHT…” – Amos 5: 11-13.
        Corruption
        A Judge who takes bribe can be blind to the truth and thus pervert the cause of justice even though he had initially sworn an oath to discharge his duties without partiality, fear or favour. The law of God says: “Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause… And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise, and perverteth the words of the righteous.” (Exodus 23: 6-8) Furthermore it is written: “A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment.” (Proverbs 17: 23) This kind of gift intended to corrupt a person is unlawful but there is nothing wrong in a gift that is an honest expression of charity which is void of a sinful motive.
        A Grade “B” Customary Court Judge was once reported to have been found guilty of “judicial corruption” in a High Court, and was sentenced to two years imprisonment. The presiding Judge, as reported, remarked that “if our Judiciary is corrupt, there is no other safe place in this country”. (Vide the West African Pilot of September 20, 1963)
        The evils of bribery are many. A driver who obtains a driving licence through bribery can constitute a menace on the public highway. A traffic offense overlooked by a policeman because of bribery can lead to a fatal accident. The blood of the victims in such a case is upon the head of that policeman as well as the driver and whoever is a party to that pernicious transaction. They are all accountable to God. Said St. Paul: “So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.” – Romans 14:12.
        Before the eyes of responsible citizens the Police deserve every respect because of the importance of their duties to humanity, and the immense benefit the citizenry derives from their services. But the pity of it is that owing to the love of money and the same mania of get-rich-quick, corruption has insinuated itself into this serviceable department.
        Cases of policemen found guilty of bribery and corruption in the law courts are many. Yet the ungodly ones do not take warning.
        A police-constable was reported to have written a letter to a herbalist requesting that the ‘spirit’ be invoked to protect him so that he could take bribe. The Daily Times, issue of October 8, 1965, published that a first-class constable admitted in the Chief Magistrate’s Court writing a letter in which he requested the spirit to “protect me from the hands of my enemy. I wish to be promoted to the maximum rank in the Nigeria police force by 1968…Give me protection so that I could take bribe while checking on the road”.
        The report added that the policeman “claimed that he was compelled to write it at the cemetery” and that he also went to the house of the herbalist, who was said to be his brother-in-law, to ask for medicine to cure stomach trouble and jaundice”.
        Granted that a fake herbalist had promised all the “sweet nonsense” to a public officer and perhaps given him a dirty ring as an assurance of what the ‘spirit’ could do, we can just imagine what the character of that officer would be in his department.
        The honest and God-fearing members of the Force will be doing a great service to the nation if they do not cover the corrupt ones whenever there is a clue to their criminal acts. It is not only a disgrace but also a betrayal of trust for any constable, who ought to enforce the law, to engage in clandestine corrupt practices. Such ones deserve no sympathy; they must be exposed and brought to book in order to save the good name of the Force and so that it may always command the confidence and respect of the public.
        There are also allegations of bribery in certain hospitals, and it is true that some members of the public induce public servants to take bribes. In the Daily Times of June 18, 1960, it was published that “the Onitsha Branch of the Nigerian Union of Nurses has blamed ‘over anxious’ patients in connection with the allegation that some of the Onitsha General Hospital Staff were being tipped before hospital staff could attend them”, Any hospital staff who takes bribes from “over anxious” patients is himself a disgrace to, his noble humanitarian profession. And is it not true that some nurses are sometimes negligent, or cause delay, and make things difficult for some patients to make them “over anxious” in order to give bribes?
        Awful Disclosure
        The former Chairman of the Nigerian Railway Corporation, Sir Ralf Emerson, admitted before the Elias Commission of Inquiry, that “there was corruption in every establishment, and that his Corporation was no exception”. (Vide the Daily Times of May 26, 1960). Sir Ralf deserved compliments for his frank statement, but we hold the view that the fact that corruption exists in “every establishment” is no ground for any top-man to wink at or take a less serious view of it in his own circle. No reasonable person will steal or throw acid upon himself because foolish people do so. “Act well your part, and there the honour lies.”
        The head of a department who does nothing to resist or eliminate corrupt practices going on under his nose gives room for the inference that he himself is also corrupt.
        In 1963, the Railway and Ports Trans- port Staff Union made an allegation of mal-practices in matters of promotion in the Nigerian Railway Corporation and urged the Federal Minister of Transport to conduct an investigation into it. Following this, the Chairman of the Corporation told the Daily Times: “It is true the union has on a number of occasions made allegations of bribery and corruption but the allegations have never been substantiated.” (Daily Times of Nov. 30, 1963) But the report of the recent probe into the affairs of the Nigerian Railway Corporation but an awful disclosure of stinking corruption affecting some of its very top officials. Some of them have been sacked or barred from holding public offices. (Daily Times, April 20, 1968)
        Before the Military take-over of Government, there were reports that some people left jobs of high salaries for those of low wages all because of the avenue open to them to grab bribes in the low-income ones. This shameless sort of people demanded anything – whisky, brandy, yams, cocks and even eggs – from people for their selfish ends.
        The public life of Nigeria was damn corrupt. Ten percent had become a popular “epithet” for bribes. Is it not true that some honourable members’ speeches were sometimes drowned with shouts of “wuru wuru” and such like in Parliament? And were some Ministers not really corrupt? We can recall a publication in the defunct Daily Service of May 16, 1959, stating that “a corrupt Minister is a greater danger to the country than anyone or anything can be. He can sell the nation while pretending to protect her interests…And no true Nigerian would like to see an independent Nigeria tossed about by FILTHY LUCRE… We are developing a false sense of values in this country. There is the feeling abroad that politics is a money making business…”
        Weaknesses
        Sometime in 1965, a Member of Parliament asked the then Prime Minister as to when he intended “to introduce the projected legislation to deal with corruption as promised in two previous addresses by His Excellency to Parliament”. In answer, the Prime Minister said: “The proposal was abandoned because all the Governments in the Federation were not unanimous in introducing uniform legislation to deal with corruption. It was found that the main object of the projected legislation would be completely frustrated by persons involved transferring accounts to banks operating elsewhere in the Republic.” This was published in the House of Representatives Official Report of Parliamentary Debates (Second Parliament! Volume 18, No. 17, of Thursday, 22nd April, 1965.
        The difficulties of the Prime Minister were quite understandable; but were those not ‘some of the weaknesses of his Government which had led to a chain of events until we now find ourselves in the throes of a civil war?
        Let us now take stock of ourselves. What have we really gained, as individuals or as a nation, from all the hustle and bustle of dirty politics and the wealth corruptly acquired since our Independence? Is it not true that some had died before their time, others in jail and some others are now languishing in misery and dejection?
        God’s word is always true. Some men may brush it aside or attempt to suppress it, but it will yet have its way and come true. King Solomon, under the inspiration of God, stated that righteousness exalts a nation, and added. “But SIN is a reproach to any people”. (Proverbs 14: 34) Have we not seen enough of this reproach in our country?
        Today, Nigeria is groaning because of the heinous sins of some of her people which include bribery and corruption. The Government had been robbed of many good things through the corruption of certain people who were placed in privileged positions. There is doubt whether certain individuals were not even richer than the Government. Now, it is everybody including the innocent and oppressed poor that is bearing the brunt of their iniquities. It was Jeremiah the prophet who lamented: “Our fathers have sinned, and are not; and we have borne their iniquities.” (Lamentation 5: 7) May God Almighty come to the rescue of the poor and oppressed and spare Nigeria for His mercy’s sake. Amen.
        Wealth acquired through corruption or any other evil means is a curse, and decent people who are godly-minded have no respect for those who thrive on bribery and corruption. Unless they repent they shall die suddenly and leave them to others. Thus said the Lord: “As the partridge sitteth on egg s, and hatcheth them not; so he that getteth riches, and not by right, shall leave them in the midst of his days, and at his end shall be a fool.” “Though he heap up silver as the dust and prepare raiment as the clay;… the just shall put it on, and the innocent shall divide the silver…”- Jeremiah 17: 11; Job 27: 13-23.
        Retribution
        The Chief Justice of the Federal Supreme Court of Nigeria, Sir Adetokunbo Ademola, was once interviewed by a representative of the African Challenge and was quoted as saying that “fraud, bribery, and corruption are sin”. He went on, “The offender may enjoy wealth acquired through wickedness and escape punishment while alive, but his children and his grandchildren after him very often suffer poverty and wretchedness because of his dishonest life. ” (Vide the African Challenge of March 1962).
        It is true that children do suffer the retribution of their father’s wickedness, more so from God when they (the children) themselves behave like their father. But God provides in His law that if the children fear Him and do righteousness the iniquities of their father will not be visited upon them. – Numbers 14: 18; Exodus 20: 5, 6; Deuteronomy 24: 16; Psalm 106: 3; Acts 10:34,35.
        We will add that if the dishonest man perchance escapes man’s punishment, he can never escape that of God. This is more the reason why men should fear God and “abstain from all appearance of evil”. (1 Thessalonians 5: 22) And St. Paul stated: “For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.” – 2 Corinthians 5: 10.
        How can the disease of bribery and corruption be cured? Please, read what the Chief Justice says backed with the soul- saving word of God in the next issue of “The Weekly Sermon”.
        
        May the good Lord help His sheep to do His will always so that they may be truly rich and saved. Amen.`,

        content:`“THAT which is ill got, though it may increase much, will not last long. A man may perhaps, raise a great estate in a little time, by usury and extortion, fraud and oppression of the poor, but it will not continue; he gathers it for himself, but it shall prove to have been gathered for somebody else that he has no kindness for,” says Henry.
    
        We have always made it quite clear that it is not a sin for one to be rich. Solomon, who himself was the richest king in his days, said: “The blessing of the Lord, it maketh rich, and He addeth no sorrow with it.” (Proverbs 10: 22) But the trouble with many people in our time is that they amass wealth through fraud, bribery and corruption, oppression of the poor and other evil means.
        
        The God’s Kingdom Society (GKS) had long foreseen that Nigeria would, sooner or later, be plunged into chaos because of the excesses of certain politicians and some godless people who though t that money was all that mat t ere d in life. They therefore stopped at nothing in making themselves, by hook or by crook, to be rich. Thus many others in the public services and in private lives developed an unrestricted bent towards material acquisition, and the Nigerian society became infested with bribery and corruption and their attendant evils. Indeed, the Bible says: “He that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye, and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him.” – Proverbs 28: 22.
        
        GKS Vindicated
        
        Our warnings against the godless and materialistic tendencies and ideologies of the politicians and their followers, before and after Nigerian Independence, were not heeded; rather we were called names. Yes, “the poor man’s wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard”. (Ecclesiastes 9: 16) But how is it today? has the GKS not been vindicated?
        
         
        
        We can recall that as far back as 1958, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe admitted at the banned NCNC Executive Committee meeting held at the Lagos City College, that they had followed the “SELFISH DESIRES OF OUR OWN HEARTS”. This happened when there was an internal wrangle in the party. He asked his colleagues in that meeting to close their eyes while he read this prayer:
        “Our Father in heaven, we pray that You save us from ourselves. The world that You made for us, to live in peace we have made into an armed camp. We live in fear of war to come…We have turned from You to go our selfish way. We have broken Your commandments and denied Your truth. We have left your altars to serve the false gods of money and pleasure and power. Forgive us and help us. Now, darkness gathers around us and we are confused in all our counsels…” (Vide the Daily Times of June 16, 1958, page l6 – italics ours)
        
        Let the lovers of money read over again and ponder the above prayer.
        
        It is a pity that some of the very ills, which include bribery and corruption, that led to the fall of the First Republic are still rearing their ugly heads in Nigeria up till today. Many people are hypocrites. For while they pay lip-services to the cause of Nigerian unity, they perpetrate the evils that can ruin the nation, and make difficult for the honest ones the task of keeping Nigeria united.
        
        New Order
        
        When the Military Government came into power, it promised among other things that “in the new order of things, there should be no place for subjugation of personal service to personal aggrandisement, nepotism and corruption”. This was made known by the former Head of the Military Government, the late Major-General Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi, at a meeting in State House, Lagos, in February 1966. (Daily Times, February 22, 1966)
        
        In a “Statement of Policy” broadcast to the nation in August 1966, the present Head of the Military Government, Major- General Yakubu Gowon, stated: “One point which I had not hitherto made abundantly clear is that my Government is very determined to stamp out corrupt practices and to bring to book all persons, including those recently released from detention, against whom there is evidence of improper practice and criminal acts.” (Morning Post, August 10, 1966).
        
        Following this assurance of the Military Government, certain measures have been taken by way of inquiries both at Federal level and in some of the States. The findings made known so far are shocking and reveal how corrupt some people, being looked upon as “gentlemen” and godly, are. We congratulate the Federal and State Military Governments on their bold steps in exposing evils and depriving crooks of their ill-gotten gains.
        
        Some people do not fear God, neither do they learn from past mistakes or the experience of others. Today, bribery and corruption are again in full swing. The sins of those engaged in it shall find them out in God’s time. – Numbers 32: 23.
        Addressing a meeting of some officials of Local Government Councils in the Mid- Western State, the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Benin City, was reported as saying, “Revenue collectors who should collect taxes to swell the coffers of the council in fact swell their own coffers by taking bribes of 5/- to 10/- from tax defaulters who find this cheaper than paying the normal expected tax of £3: 10/-. As a result the officials get richer and make capital investments all over the place out of proportion to their income level while the council gets poorer and cannot even maintain the rudimentary roads in its area.” (Vide the Mid-Western Nigeria PRESS RELEASE of Thursday August 22, 1968).
        
        Bribe-mongers have formed their own terms and phrases for the purpose of begging for tips or demanding bribes. The saying, “nothing goes for nothing”, is common among them. The words, “kola” and “dash” are their popular synonyms for the word, bribe. You enter an office to ask for something to which you are entitled but the officer in charge, if he is of the corrupt type, will then tell you: “If you know how to ‘walk’, or if you ‘walk’ well, you will get it.” Is it not surprising that a fully grown-up man must have to learn again how to walk in some offices? If you are not the sort of those who are used to such dastardly language or the “kola game”, the officer and his colleagues may even laugh at your “ignorance” for not knowing what people are doing or for not “behaving as a gentleman “.
        
        It is our humble appeal that the Authorities should do everything humanly possible to get rid of this kind of evil men or vicious “beggars” in the public services of the country.
        
        According to the Law Book of God, the Bible, it is not only those whose corrupt practices have come to the open that are guilty of sin, but also those whose offences are hidden. Except those still covered repent thoroughly to the pleasure of God, their “secret sins” shall be revealed in due time and great will be their shame. (Psalm 90: 8; Hebrews 4: 13) St. Paul said: “Some men’s sins are open before hand, going before to judgment; and some men they follow after. Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand; and they that lire otherwise cannot be hid.”- 1 Timothy 5: 24, 25.
        
        Another factor that is hardening the hearts of some people in their corrupt dealings is their hope in the secret societies to which they belong. It must be pointed out to such ones that their days are awaiting them. For when their cups of iniquity shall have been filled, God shall deal with them and reward them with the fruit of their doings. No secret society or human effort then can help them.
        
        We believe that there are good people in secret societies. We appeal to such ones not to help the bad characters who, among them, involve themselves in criminal acts. If they do, they will be partakers of their iniquities or crimes; and though they may avert man’s punishment or that of the Government, they CANNOT AVERT OR ESCAPE GOD’S OWN. HE WILL CERTAINLY PUNISH THEM. – Proverbs 11: 21; Isaiah 3: 11; 1 Peter 3: 10-12; Ecclesiastes I2: 13 14.
        
        The Role of the Church
        
        In a situation such as we find in this country, the role of the Church is of paramount importance. Religious leaders must always come out in a straightforward condemnation of evils such as fraud, bribery and corruption, and so forth. Their spiritual responsibilities are very great. This can better be appreciated from the following charge of God to His servant: “So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my month, and warn them from me. When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand. Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.”- Ezekiel 33: 7-9.
        
        All those who have been found to be corrupt and others not yet revealed are mostly members of one religious group or another. But what have their leaders done to check their excesses in violation of God’s commandments? It is in this respect many church leaders in Nigeria have been charged with duplicity and as having failed in their spiritual duties.
        
        After the tragic events or January 15, 1966, which resulted in a change of Government, the Baptist Church of Nigeria did a praiseworthy thing in promptly coming out with an open admission of their fault for lying dormant while some of their members who were politicians committed sinful acts in careless freedom. A document captioned, “MEMO OF THE NATIONAL SITUA TION” dated February 1st, 1966, and signed by a leader of the Baptist Church, speaks for itself and states in part:
        
        “During the five years when the British no longer determined our policies we have witnessed the effects of sin in various aspects of our national life. We have learnt to accommodate ourselves to acts of selfishness, greed, lusts, pride, corruption, tribalism, deceit. Less and less the freedom we had hoped were inherent in the lives of an independent nation became illusive…
        
        “We Baptists once derived joy as champions of freedom and justice, of truth and honesty. However, our heads are bowed in shame as people observed that the distressing atrocities were committed in the area where our denomination had the strongest influence, where many Baptists were in key positions in Government and quasi-Government bodies. Many of us in the Ministry and in teaching, as well as in other walks of life, become ardent supporters of evil policies and practices in total disregard of Jesus Christ and his demands. We flattered corrupt politicians for personal private profit. We sang their praises in the Assembly of God’s people. We connived at sin. Worst still, when some try to proclaim what they understand the will of God to be-two or three instances of such actually came to our hearing- some frightened Christians warned them to be careful! We are living in fear! Need I extend the catalogue further to indicate how all of us were implicated in the moral confusion of the times? May God forgive us!”
        
        The Baptist Church is not alone in this sort of unchristian attitude in tacitly permitting evil. There are several other religious bodies that are equally guilty, and they know themselves. However, the frankness and sincerity of the Baptist Church in owning its fault is appreciated. May God forgive them as they have prayed. But the GKS – this is no self -praise-on several occasions warned the nation against sin; her Press Release in the Daily Times of September 30, 1960 on the eve of Independence captioned, “Only By Righteousness will Independent Nigeria Survive”, is an instance.
        
        Before the Military take-over in January 1966, the GKS, through her President also warned against the danger ahead if things continued as they were at that time. Copies of the warning letter were sent to the late Prime Minister, the then Regional Governors and Premiers, Dr. Orizu, Acting President of the Federal Government, religious leaders and leading politicians in the country. But the warning was not heeded. Today, it is all of us – the guilty and the stubborn ones as well as the innocent – that are suffering! May God have mercy on us.
        
        Although the Military Government has promised to stamp out corruption, we will be expecting too much to think that it can go beyond the limit of human strength. But it can do and achieve much with the support and co-operation of godly, honest people. The power to wipe out evil from the entire surface of the earth, rests with God alone. And very soon in this our Age, He, through Jesus Christ, will take action towards this end, and ALL INIQUITY will come to an end.
        
        The Remedy
        
        Chief Justice Ademola was reported as saying “that bribery, though a dangerous disease, is curable”, And he added, “It can be cured only through a deep spiritual awakening, through the Ministry of the Christian Church,” (African Challenge of March 1962, emphasis ours)
        
        We agree with the Chief Justice, Anyone who claims to be a Christian and still indulges in bribery is not yet converted. St. Paul admonished that we should be transformed by the renewing of our minds so that we might prove “what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God”. (Romans 12: 1,2) And he further said: “Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things (including fraud, bribery and corruption) are passed away; behold, all things are become new.” – 2 Corinthians 5: 17.
        
        We have said enough to expose the vanity of false riches and the dangers of bribery and corruption. If those still engaging in them do not repent, all they acquire through bribery and corruption shall be destroyed by God. As it is written: “For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery, They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit.” – Job 15: 34, 35.
        
        Our humble advice is that those who have been giving or receiving bribes should repent of their sins so that God may forgive them. There is no sense in continuing to do that which always pricks your conscience, incurs the anger of men, lowers your prestige, and will eventually bring you the condemnation of God. It was the Psalmist who prayed: “Judge me, O LORD; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in the LORD; therefore I shall not slide. Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men: in whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes,” – Psalm 26: 1, 9-10.
        
        In Isaiah 55: 7, there is the warning that the wicked should forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his evil thoughts; that he should return to God and He will have mercy upon him. And Jesus Christ directed an assuring call to all mankind when he said: “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.” – Matthew 11: 28-30.
        
        No matter how many and serious your past sins may be, take an advantage of this opportunity you have of hearing or reading this sermon, and REPENT and retrace your steps to Jesus so that his salvation and other blessings may be your lot.
        
        It pays to fear God, and to lead a godly and sober life. We cannot end this sermon without reminding you of the following admonition of St. Paul: “But godliness with contentment is great gain. For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out. And having food and raiment let us be therewith content. But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition. For the love of money is the root of all evil which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.” – I Timothy 6: 6-10.
        
        And to every true Christian the apostle added this exhortation: “But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness. Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, where- unto thou art also called and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.” – 1 Timothy 6: 11, 12.
        
        The remedy for the disease of bribery and corruption lies, therefore, in the fear of God by which “men depart from evil”. (Proverbs 16: 6) Christ’s warning is that men should “beware of covetousness”. – Luke 12: 15- 21; see also Hebrews 13: 5, 6.
        
        O God, help us Thy sheep to keep Thy commandments always as eloquent evidence of our love for Thee and Thy Son our Redeemer so that we may be saved. Amen.`,

        content:`AMONG the promises of God Almighty, that of the resurrection of the dead is one of the most outstanding showing the greatness of His power and His good purpose towards mankind.  It is the pivot upon which rests the hope of Christians concerning the dead, and if not for this hope man cannot count himself as anything better than a beast.
        Resurrection means a rising from the dead, or the act of bringing back to life. It is one of the fundamental doctrines of the Christian faith in the Holy Bible.
        When Adam sinned the sentence of death was passed upon him by God. Consequently, his offspring having been born in sin were declared guilty and thus death, which is the penalty of sin, was brought upon the entire human race. – Genesis 3: 17-19; Romans 5: 12-19; 6: 23.
        To think that this world will continue in sin under the wicked overlordship of the devil forever is ignorance of the divine purpose. God had promised to set up a new order of things both in heaven and earth – the New World now in the making – in which there shall be nothing evil. Concerning this grand arrangement of God, St. Peter declared: “Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.”- 2 Peter 3: 13.
        The Lord’s Promise
        In order that His faithful worshippers who have died may have the golden opportunity of enjoying the bliss of that New World – THE WORLD WITHOUT END – as a reward of their loyalty and services, God promised not only to redeem man from the power of the grave by the resurrection of the dead but also to bring death to an end. He declared: “I will ransom them from the power of the grave: I will redeem them from death: O death, 1 will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction: repentance shall be hid from mine eyes.”- Hosea 13: 14.
        The ancient faithful before Christ built their hope upon the Lord’s promise. They knew that death was just a temporal state which could not bar them from coming back to receive their reward from God at His appointed time.
        Job, a prophet of God, who underwent fiery temptations at the instance of the devil, spoke of the grave as a hiding place and hoped earnestly for the time when God would bring about his change at the resurrection. He said: “O that Thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that Thou wouldest keep me secret, until Thy wrath be past, that Thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!” (Job 14: 13) He asked, “If a man die, shall he live again?” Yes, of course. He then went on, “All the days of my appointed time will I wait, (in the grave) till my change come. Thou (God) shalt can, and I win answer Thee: Thou wilt have desire to the work of Thine hands.” (Verses 14 and 15).
        Job did not stop at this, for the Spirit of God further moved him into a more positive, prophetic declaration of his belief, thus: “For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: and though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God…” – Job 19: 25-27.
        There is also the instance of the prophecy of Isaiah concerning the resurrection of the dead. He said: “Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.” –  Isaiah 26: 19.
        That children are also among those to be raised from the dead is a fact having concrete support of the Scriptures. When Herod, the wicked king, massacred innocent children in Bethlehem in his attempt to kill the infant, Jesus, God comforted the bereaved with the assurance that their children would come to life again from the grave termed “the land of the enemy” in fulfillment of His prophecy recorded in Jeremiah 31: 15-17. See also Matt. 2: 13-18.
        When Jesus Christ came to this earth he confirmed in his teachings that resurrection is a reality. There was an occasion when he crossed swords with the Sadducees on the question of resurrection and defeated them. The Sadducees did not believe in resurrection, and so they asked him: “Master, Moses said, ‘If a man should die childless, his brother shall marry the widow and carry on his brother’s family.’ Now we knew of seven brothers. The first married and died, and as he was without issue his wife was left to his brother. The same thing happen with the second, and the third, and so on with all seven. Last of all the woman died. At the resurrection, then, whose wife will she be, for they had all married her? – Matthew 22: 23-28; New English Bible.
        In his answer, Jesus told them point- blank: “You are mistaken, because you know neither the scriptures nor the power of God. At the resurrection men and women do not marry, but are like angels in heaven.” – Matthew 22: 29, 30, N. E. B.
        Keys of Hell
        Jesus Christ even made it known that he is the one whom the Heavenly Father had vested with the power to raise the dead. He said: “For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will. Verily, verily, I say unto you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.” (John 5: 21, 25-27) That was why he told Martha: “I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.” -John 11: 25.
        He showed an example of the power when Lazarus who had died and had already been four days in the tomb, was raised to life by him. – John 11: 32-45.
        The devil caused Jesus Christ to be killed by wicked men with the intent, no doubt, to defeat the all-important purpose of God. But the Most High, in exercise of His infinite power, raised him from the dead the third day and crowned him with power, glory and honour. Jesus himself declared: “I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.” (Revelation 1: 18) The “keys” in this context are symbolic of the power or authority to release the dead from “hell”, that is, the grave; and put an end to death.
        The resurrection of Jesus Christ was a clear demonstration of the certainty of God’s promise as regards the rising again of the dead, and has strongly enlivened the hope of all Christians. – 1 Peter 1: 3.
        In defence of the Christian faith, the early apostles preached the resurrection from the dead. (Acts 4: 1-4; 17: 18) Because of St. Paul’s belief and teaching about it, he suffered persecutions and prosecutions at the hands of the unbelieving Jews. When he was indicted before King Agrippa he declared: “And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers; unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hope’s sake, King Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.” He then asked, “Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?” – Acts 26: 6-8.
        Indisputable Fact
        St. Paul, in his first epistle to the Corinthians, stated that if there was no resurrection then all the preaching and sufferings of Christians were vain.
        He added: “For if the dead rise not then is not Christ raised. If Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sin… If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.” He proved clearly that resurrection is an indisputable fact. – 1 Corinthians 15: 12-33.
        For anyone, therefore, to have doubt about the possibility of resurrection is an evidence of lack of faith. It was from the dust of the ground God made man, and if man turns to dust again there is no reason why it should be considered an impossibility for God to bring him back to life.
        But some may ask, “How are the dead raised? and what kind of body will they have?” To such questions St. Paul gave an illustrative answer to the effect that the seed you sow in the ground does not grow into a plant unless it “dies” first. And when the green shoot comes up out of the seed, it is very different from the seed you first planted. For what you sow is just a dry little seed, perhaps of wheat, of some other kind. “But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased Him, and to every seed his own body…So also is the resurrection of the dead”, said St. Paul. “It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.” – 1 Corinthians 15: 35-43.
        One salient point which some people seldom consider is that it is not only the righteous that will be resurrected but the wicked as well. And everyone will be rewarded by God according to his works – good or bad. It is an understanding of these Scriptural facts that have always made the true worshippers of God to be zealous and steadfast in their faith not- withstanding the threats of death by the wicked. They know that even if they are killed because of their conviction God will raise them from the dead to glory in due course. So, too, a wicked man who escapes punishment in this life will come again to face the consequences of his actions.
        
        While some at the resurrection, will be rewarded abundantly with everlasting blessings, others will be punished and covered with shame. Concerning this Daniel, under the inspiration of the Al- mighty God, prophesied: “And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.” – Daniel 12: 2.
        First Resurrection
        The order and classification of resurrection are shown in the Scriptures. St. Paul stated: “But every man in his own order: Christ the first fruits; after- ward they that are Christ’s at his’ coming.” (1 Corinthians 15: 23).
        There is the first resurrection which is that of Jesus Christ and the Saints who are the Anointed Christians numbering 144,000. Among the disciples of Jesus the anointed ones are the first class. They constitute the “Little Flock” of which the twelve apostles were foundation members. (Luke 12: 32; James 1: 18) They die in the flesh but they are raised as spirits like Jesus to dwell in heaven – the New Heaven – and reign with Christ in his glorious Kingdom. – 1 Peter 3: 18; 2 Corinthians 5: 1-4.
        When St. Paul stated, “It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body” (1 Cor. 15: 44) he was referring to the death and resurrection of those of the “Little Flock” of which he is one. And he added: “And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly. Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.”- 1 Corinthians 15: 49, 50.
        The Scriptures show vividly that it .is at the second presence of Jesus Christ in the last days that the first resurrection would take place. (John 14: 1-3; 1 Corinthians 15: 44-57; 2 Timothy 4: 6-8; Philippians 3: 20; 1 Thessalonians 4: 16; Revelation 20: 4-6; etc.) This is already fulfilling but being events of a spiritual nature many people including religious leaders and theologians do not know.
        Better Resurrection
        The faithful men and women of old before Christ will have their part in what St. Paul described as a “better resurrection”. (Hebrews 11: 4-40) They will all be raised from the dead to dwell on this earth, not in heaven, to receive their reward. Concerning them, St. Paul wrote: “Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens. Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured. not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection.” – Hebrews 11: 33-35.
        What a wonderful, glorious and happy occasion it will be when those great just men and women will come back from “the land of the enemy” and team up with the faithful Christians on earth! But with the enemies of truth and righteousness, shame, wailing and torment will be their portion. Jesus Christ, knowing this, spoke of how there would be weeping and gnashing of teeth when those who falsely claim God’s Kingdom would be driven out of it while the true Christians from all corners of the earth would be in it with Abraham and other ancient worthies who shall have then been resurrected. – Matthew 8: 11, 12; Luke 13: 28,29.
        General Resurrection
        Finally, there will be a general resurrection during which all the remaining good people as well as bad ones will find their feet on earth again. The good will be rewarded with everlasting life in perfect peace and happiness in paradise on earth while the bad ones will be judged and punished according to their sins, Concerning this Jesus said: “Wonder not at this; for the hour cometh, wherein all that are in the graves shall bear the voice of the Son of God. And they that have done good things shall come forth unto the resurrection of life; but they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment.” – John 5: 28,29. (Douay Version)
        What is more, St. Paul confessed his faith about resurrection before Felix and said among other things: “But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they can heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets: And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.”- Acts 24: 14, 15.
        Great Comfort
        It is because of this glorious hope of the resurrection of the dead, which is a great comfort to those having its understanding, true Christians do not mourn for the dead like the pagans who have no hope. To this end Paul the apostle, gave this exhortation: “But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. Wherefore comfort one another with these words.” – 1 Thessalonians 4: 13, 14, 18.

        content:`OF all the divers laws and ordinances enacted by God through Moses the prophet, the Sabbath Law was one of those the breaking of which carried capital punishment. But the advent of Jesus Christ brought a modification of the law and, subsequently, the understanding that the Sabbath was among those things which were a shadow of things to come.
        The sabbath day was the seventh day of the week on which the children of Israel were by law enjoined to refrain from all kinds of work. This was one of the Ten Commandments. God said: “Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.” – Exodus 20: 8-11.

        It was a requirement of the law that no fire should be kindled on the sabbath day. The law was stringent, and the penalty for breaking it was death. In Exodus 35: 2-3, it is written: “Six days shall work be done but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD: whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to death. Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day.”
        
         
        
        There was an occasion when the children of Israel were in the wilderness that a certain man who was gathering sticks on the sabbath day was caught. The man was brought before Moses and Aaron, and all the congregation of the people. He was found guilty, and God’s sentence was this: “The man shall be surely put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.” Indeed this sentence of the Lord was at once executed. – Numbers 15: 32-36.
        
         
        
        After the return of the Jews from Babylonish captivity, the faithful observed the sabbath law with all seriousness. Trading on the sabbath day was prohibited. (Nehemiah 10: 31) It happened at one time that when Nehemiah the prophet took notice that some of the Jews violated the sabbath by making purchases on that day, he strongly objected. And because of the misconduct of the people in this regard, he ordered that the gates of Jerusalem should be shut and should not be opened until the sabbath was over.
        
        Here is his own record:
        
        “In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals. There dwelt men of Tyre also therein which brought fish, and all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem. Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, what evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day? And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I at the gates that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.” – Nehemiah 13:15-17.
        
         
        
        Modification
        
        Long before Jesus Christ was born on the earth, the prophet Moses, moved by the Spirit of God, had told the nation of Israel in a prophecy concerning him (Christ) thus: “The LORD thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from among the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken.” – Deuteronomy 18: 15.
        
         
        
        As a matter of fact, the advent of Jesus Christ brought about a change from the old to the new covenant. It was because the unbelieving Jews in his days ignored the prophetic instruction about the expected Messiah – the Greater Prophet – that they failed to recognise or acknowledge the pre-eminent position of Jesus Christ. In John 1: 17, it is written: “For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.”
        
         
        
        By virtue of the authority God gave to Jesus Christ, he modified the Sabbath Law. There was never a time he taught his disciples to keep the sabbath. Rather, he showed – by precept and example – that for doing any good work on the sabbath day no one deserved to be punished.
        
         
        
        One of the things that often brought conflict between Jesus Christ and the fanatical Jews was the question of the Sabbath. He did good works on the Sabbath day and even allowed his disciples “to pluck ears of corn, and to eat”, which according to the Pharisees was “not lawful to do upon the Sabbath day” – Matthew 12:1-8; Mark 2:23-28.
        
         
        
        In the synagogue of the Jews into which he went there was a man with a withered hand. And when the Pharisees asked whether it was lawful to heal a man on the sabbath day in order to find fault with him, he answered: “What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out? How much more then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days.” – Matthew 12: 9-12. See also Mark 3: 1-5.
        
         
        
        There was another occasion when Jesus Christ, on the sabbath day, cured an impotent man at the pool of Bethesda. Instead of the Jews to glorify God and rejoice with the man who was cured, they harassed him saying, “It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.” But the poor fellow replied, “He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.” (John 5: 1-11) And when the hardhearted Jews knew that it was Jesus who cured the man, they persecuted him “and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day”. (verses 15, 16) Notwithstanding, Jesus defended himself and justified his action by saying, “My Father has never yet ceased His work, and I am working too.” – verse 17, New English Bible.
        
        Moreover, none of the apostles of Jesus Christ ever enjoined the Christian believers to observe the sabbath. When the council of the Apostles and elders in Jerusalem sent word to the Gentile converts at Antioch, Syria and Cilicia as to what they should do, they did not ask them to keep the sabbath. – Acts 15: 22-31.
        
         
        
        Shadow
        
        That the sabbath law was among those Ordinances blotted out by Jesus Christ, as stated by St Paul, is beyond argument. For this reason the apostle admonished: “Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of a holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days: which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.” – Colossians 2: 14-17.
        
         
        
        The bottom has been knocked off the argument of those who hold that Christians should keep the sabbath. It is wrong to stick to the demands of the Mosaic law instead of the truth and faith of Jesus Christ. St. Paul showed clearly that the law served as a kind of tutor to lead the Jews to Christ and that since he (Christ) had come “we are no longer under a schoolmaster”. (Galatians 3: 23-25) He also said: “Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ…” – Galatians 2: 16.
        
        Among the churches that claim to be keeping the Sabbath, there is disagreement as to whether Saturday or Sunday is the sabbath day. There should be no dispute over this if men would be true to themselves. The seventh day of the week, according to the Bible (Exodus 20: 10,11), which is Saturday, is the sabbath day. In his Encyclopedia of Religion and Religions, E. Royston Pike, an ecclesiastical scholar, stated: “Among Jews the sabbath is reckoned from Friday sunset to Saturday sunset.” (Page 332).
        
         
        
        Sunday Observance
        
        The change of the sabbath from Saturday to Sunday was made by Constantine, a Roman emperor. He made a law in 321 A.D. for the observance of Sunday throughout the Roman Empire. About this, Frank Loris Peterson wrote: “Seeking to please both the Christians. Who observed the seventh-day Sabbath, and the pagans, who worshipped the sun on the first day of the week, he (Constantine) ‘artfully balanced the hopes and fears of his subjects by publishing in the same year two edicts, the first of which enjoined the solemn observance of Sunday, and the second directed the regular consultation of the Aruspices (a pagan practice).'” (The Hope of the Race, pages 110-111). His quotation was from the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire by Edward Gibbon.
        
         
        
        Concerning the Sunday observance, The American Peoples Encyclopedia states: “Historically, Sunday came to be identified with the Sabbath, specifically in regard to its observance. The Emperor Constantine’s decree A.D. 321, making Sunday a day of rest from general labor, but providing for exceptions, such as keeping open the market place, is an example of civil laws regulating the day’s observance after Christianity had become a legal religion.” (Vol. 16, page 845).
        
         
        
        The teaching that Christians, as the Explanatory Catechism says, are “commanded to keep the Sunday holy” is a distortion of Bible truth. Many of the wrongs in Christendom sprang from the imposition of Roman paganism upon Christian practices.
        
         
        
        People know that those claiming to be keeping the sabbath – Saturday or Sunday – are deceiving themselves. If we are to go by the terms of the sabbath law, we do not think that any of the so-called sabbath – keepers would be living since the penalty for breaking it was death. Do some not go to the offices to work on Sundays or Saturdays? Do they not kindle fire, make purchases or do some other works? If they don’t, granted, what about their children, servants, or domestic animals? The law says, “Thou shalt not do ANY work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates.” – Exodus 20: 10.
        
         
        
        However, the vital point we must emphasise, is that Christians are not bound to keep the sabbath-be it Saturday or Sunday. One is free to rest oneself any day. The law of faith and grace under Christ does not tie anyone to a particular day to rest. The sabbath is not to control us; and Jesus Christ told the Pharisees: “The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath: therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.” – Mark 2: 27-28.
        
         
        
        Real Rest
        
        The word sabbath means rest. The time for the real rest or sabbath that God promised His true worshippers, of which the Mosaic sabbath was a type, has not come. That will be in God’s Kingdom fully established, and it is towards that rest we as Christians are labouring. Concerning that antitypical rest, St. Paul wrote: “For if Jesus (that is, Joshua) had given them (the Jews) rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day. There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God…Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, least any man fall after the same example of unbelief.” – Hebrews 4: 8-11.
        
        Jesus Christ, the Leader and Master of Christians, worked on the sabbath day. If therefore his disciples work on the sabbath day, they do not break God’s law since Jesus Christ whom Moses told the Jews to look to and obey, has amended the law. “The sabbath”, said he, “was made for man and not man for the sabbath.” This is the truth and it is clear.`,

        content:`THE only hope of suffering humanity the perfect Kingdom of God. All through the chequered history of world empire, never had there existed any system of government that satisfied the needs of mankind. But because God’s Kingdom has the answer to all human problems and woes it is rightly designated in the Scriptures as “the desire of all nation”.
    
     
    
        Not many people have an accurate knowledge of what the Kingdom of God is. To some who professed to be Christians, it means going to heaven to enjoin eternal bliss; others regard it as a good living or a life of pleasure in this world; and yet some others say that God’s Kingdom is in one’s “belly” when one does not allow evil to rule one’s heart.
        
         
        
        The word kingdom is intelligibly defined in The Conscise Oxford Dictionary as a “territory subject to king”. Thus God’s Kingdom is the universal empire or government of righteousness and peace covering both heaven and earth to be inhabited by spirit persons and human beings, under the control of Jehovah, the Almighty God, “Who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings and Lord of lords” (1 Timothy 6:15). This is the form of government known as Theocracy. It does not make sense, therefore, to think of God’s Kingdom as a state of condition or as something which the human belly can accommodate!
        
         
        
        God has long promised through His prophets to establish His Kingdom wherein His faithful worshippers of all ages will be blessed with eternal life in perfect peace and happiness. The history of the world is dotted with the rise and fall of government but God‟ Kingdom is one that knows no decline or decay – it is an everlasting perfect government. In glory and majesty, and all that answers to righteousness, it excels all others.
        
         
        
        King David, in one of his famous songs, declared: “All thy works shall praise thee, O LORD; and thy saints shall bless thee. They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power; To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom. Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations.” – Psalm 145:10-13.
        
         
        
        The importance of God’s Kingdom cannot be over-emphasised. It was the message of hope and salvation that Jesus Christ brought to this world. At the very beginning of his ministry on earth, he proclaimed: “Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” (Matthew 4:17) Later on, he taught his disciples to pray to our Heavenly Father:
        
        “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth,
        
        as it is in heaven.” – Matthew 6:9,10.
        
        Jesus Christ further showed the paramount importance of the Kingdom when said: “But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things (that is, our needs) shall be added unto you.” Matthew 6:33.
        
         
        
        What is more, Christ particularly instructed that the good tidings of God’s Government, which, he very well knew, would bring comfort to the poor and relief to the broken-hearted, should be proclaimed throughout the world. Said he: “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.” – Matthew 24:14
        
         
        
        Head and King
        
        The Holy Bible clearly shows that God Almighty has appointed and crowned Jesus Christ as the head and king of His glorious Government. Concerning him, Isaiah prophesied: “For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end…”(Isaiah 9:6,7) He further said: “Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.” – Isaiah 32:1.
        
         
        
        The coronation of Jesus Christ, ever before it took place in heaven, was long, long ago revealed to Daniel the prophet in a vision. He stated: “And there was given him (Christ) dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.” – Daniel 7:13,14.
        
         
        
        Jesus Christ himself testified to his kingship before Pontius Pilate during his mission on earth. He said: “My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.” And when Pilate asked him, whether he was a king, he answered positively: “Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth…” – John 18:36,37.
        
         
        
        Referring to Jesus Christ who should rule righteously in God’s Kingdom St Paul said, quoting the Psalms, “Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.” Hebrews 1:9; Psalm 45:7.
        
         
        
        The Capital
        
        The capital of God’s Kingdom is Mount Zion in heaven. It is the seat of Christ the King about whom God said: “Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.” (Psalm 2:6) With Jesus Christ in heaven, apart from the holy angels, are those who constitute his cabinet. These are the anointed Christians, the saints, numbering 144,000 chosen from among men on earth beginning from the twelve apostles. They make up the “Little Flock” as distinct from other countless disciples who are the “Other Sheep”. (Luke 12:32; John 10:16)
        
         
        
        The revelation of Jesus Christ to his apostle in a vision concerning himself and his cabinet gives no room for doubt. St John wrote: “And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb (that is, Christ – John 1:29) stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father’s name written in their foreheads…These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins (that is, in the sense of spiritual purity). These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb. And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God.” – Revelation 14:1-5.
        
         
        
        It is an indisputable fact of the Scriptures that the saints (not canonized, man-made saints) are made kings and priest under Christ to reign with him in his Kingdom. (Luke 22:28-30; Revelation 1:6; 5:10). This honour is given them by a special grace of God. Everyone of them, by reason of his calling and the anointing of the Holy Spirit, is a leader or shepherd who must devote his life wholly and solely to the service of Christ in preaching the gospel of the kingdom, as the early apostles did, in order to win souls to him. – Matthew 4:18-22; Mark 16:15-20.
        
         
        
        Kingdom on Earth
        
        We must at this junction state with all emphasis that it is not the 144,000 anointed Christians alone that will be saved as some erroneously think. There are countless numbers of others – men and women – who would be saved. But the point is that their place in God’s Kingdom is not heaven but the earth made glorious – a paradise wherein abounds perpetual happiness for the saved ones. – Psalm 37:10-11,22; 2 Peter 3:13.
        
         
        
        If only people understand the Lord’s Prayer, there would be no scramble by almost everyone for heaven. Christ taught his disciples to pray for the kingdom to come so that God’s will might be done on earth as in heaven. If these people have the understanding of, and faith in this prayer why do they want to go to heaven and not wish to be in the kingdom on earth? And if all the good will go to heaven as some preachers are teaching, who be on the earth to do the Lord’s will when the kingdom comes?
        
         
        
        However, the question as to when the Kingdom would come or whether it has come or not, will be treated in due course.
        
         
        
        Jesus Christ did not say that all the righteous would be in heaven. Rather he said, “Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.” – Matthew 5:5; see also Proverbs 2:21,22.
        
         
        
        It is great a privilege and blessing for one to be favoured to be in God’s Kingdom on earth, which is described as “the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down (to EARTH) from God out of heaven.” – Revelation 21:1,2.
        
         
        
        All the holy men and women of old before Christ as well as the dead faithful Christians who were not in the class of the “Little Flock” will be raised to life at the resurrection of the dead to become heirs of and great rulers in God’s Kingdom on earth. – Job 19:25; Isaiah 32:1; Matthew 8:11,12; Luke 14:13,14; Hebrews 11:32-40.
        
         
        
        The Bible gives the understanding that the final end of this evil world will be marked by the greatest tribulation and conflict that the world has ever known – “the battle of the great day of God Almighty”. “For then shall be great tribulation”, said Jesus Christ, “such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.” (Matthew 24:21) It is during this battle that the Devil and all his invisible and visible followers – the demons and the willfully wicked persons – will be destroyed by God through Jesus Christ and his holy army. – Daniel 12:1; 2 Thessalonians 1:7-9; Revelation 20:1-3.
        
         
        
        According to the Bible, there will be a “great multitude” of faithful Christians whom no man could number that will survive the battle of the Lord and enter the third world – The World Without End. – Daniel 12:1; John 8:51; Revelation 7:9, 10, 13-15.
        
         
        
        The Millennium which is the reign of Jesus Christ for a thousand years, will begin after the battle of the great day. (Revelation 20:4,6) It at this time that there will be a general resurrection of the just and unjust. While the just will be rewarded with everlasting life in the bliss of paradise on earth, the unjust, who either did not serve God before their death or worshipped Him but not in truth, will be punished according to their sins. (Daniel 12:1-3; John 5:28,29; Acts 24:15; Hebrews 9:27) Period of punishment for each of them will be one hundred years. (Isaiah 65:20; 2 Timothy 4:1; 1 Peter 4:5,6) This serves as a second chance for them to know God, show their obedience and subjection to Him and Christ; and it all bespeaks the justice and mercy of God. Any of them who proves obedient will at the end of the 100 years be given eternal life but the disobedient ones will be sentence to the “second death”, which means everlasting destruction. – Isaiah 65:20; Revelation 20:12-15; 21:8.
        
         
        
        The millennium is also a period of reconstruction when all the vestiges of the old world will be removed and the earth rebuilt into a paradise like the beautiful garden of Eden. (Isaiah 60:13; Ezekiel 36:33-38) When the work of reconstruction shall have been completed at the end of the 1000 years, then Jesus Christ will, as a faithful Son, handover the entire Kingdom to his Father, Jehovah, that, in the language of St Paul, “God may be all in all.” – 1 Corinthians 15:24-28.
        
         
        
        The New World
        
        It is this glorious Kingdom that is the New World God promised His faithful worshippers. The beauties of it cannot be described enough in human words. There shall be no oppression, injustice, bribery and corruption or any form of unrighteousness. Even among the beast there shall be peace and harmony; “the wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid” and so forth. Yes, there shall be peace, joy and concord everywhere! – Isaiah 11:6-9; 65:17-25.
        
         
        
        These wonderful facts of the Scriptures have been described as “the hidden wisdom” which the rulers and intellectual of the world do not know. (1 Corinthians 2:7,8) The reward of the righteous will be great. “Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.” Said St Paul. “But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.” – 1 Corinthians 2:9,10.
        
         
        
        St Peter spoke of God’s Kingdom as the “new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness”. (2 Peter 3:13) And St John who saw a vision of the New World, described it thus “And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea (that is, wickedness in a spiritual parable). And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband…And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things (in the present evil world) are passed away…” – Revelation 21:1-5
        
         
        
        With the understanding of the foregoing, no one who is spiritually inclined will fail to appreciate while the faithful have always served God in truth and laboured assiduously as to prove worthy of the New World, or while Christ asked his disciples to pray for the Kingdom to come. – Matthew 6:9,10; John 4:23,24; 8:31-32,36.
        
         
        
        That God’s perfect Kingdom is immovable and that it the only hope of distressed humanity is beyond all doubt. We therefore remind all Christians of St Paul exhortation, to wit: “Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear.” – Hebrews 12:28`,

        The God’s Kingdom Society is a purely Christian Organisation founded by the Almighty God through the instrumentality of the late Gideon Meriodere Urhobo, of the blessed memory. The late G. M. Urhobo, who was the first President of the GKS, with just an instrument chosen by God through Jesus Christ, according to the election of grace, to accomplish His purpose. – Matthew 24: 31; Acts 15: 14-18; 10: 9-35; James. 1: 18.
        
         
        
        Any religion or faith is literally organised by man but spiritually either by God Who moves and directs the man through His Spirit or by the devil. And we “know them by their fruits”. – Romans 6: 16; Matthew 7: 15-20.
        
         
        
        As a matter of fact, there is no religious organisation that can claim that God Himself came down to this earth to set it up. God has always used men, as He pleases, to carry out His will. Jesus Christ himself, when he was on earth, said: “For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of Him (God) that sent me.” – John 6: 38.
        
         
        
        Also, the early apostles of Jesus Christ were practical examples of people chosen by God to be His vessels. All the spiritual gifts and powers manifest in them and which they exerted in the work of the ministry were derived from the Almighty Father. For that reason, the glory, honour and praise of their successes must be ascribed to God who, by His grace, fitted them to their several uses.
        
         
        
        Said St. Paul, “Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man. I have planted, Apollos watered: but God gave the increase, So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase…” -1 Corinthians 3: 5-10.
        
         
        
        History
        
        The history of the God’s Kingdom Society is linked with the biography of her first President, Brother G. M. Urhobo, in respect of his career as a preacher of the gospel. He hailed from Urhobo tribe and was the second son of a kind pagan gentleman-the late Ukoli of Agbassa village in Warri, Midwestern State of Nigeria. He was educated at the Warri Government School, and he taught in Roman Catholic schools as well as the Government school, Warri, in the twenties. In June 1930, he joined the Posts and Telegraphs Department as a postal clerk and telegraphist.
        
         
        
        Undoubtedly, his strong inclination for divine knowledge fired his interest in the Holy Bible which he spent most of his time to study. The most significant experience of his life came when he fell into a trance and received the Lord’s commission. It was this remarkable occurrence that brought about the radical change in his life from a civil servant to an adroit preacher of the gospel! There was never a time he equivocated with regard to his spiritual calling; rather, he ever so well made open declarations about the grace the Lord bestowed upon him-and he lived up to it. Here is his own testimony:
        
        “After three and half years’ diligent and prayerful studies of the Holy Bible, Jesus Christ revealed himself to me in a vision and commanded me to go and proclaim the good news of God’s Kingdom (or ‘Gospel of Peace’) to all nations as the only remedy for all human sufferings and woes; to expose all the false doctrines which Satan had used to deceive the people and to keep them in ignorance of God’s Kingdom and purpose of creation; and to pronounce God’s written judgment against all wickedness.”

        Under the circumstances, it was virtually impossible for him to continue to serve under the Nigerian Colonial Government. He had no other alternative than to obey the Lord’s command, like St. Paul of Bible fame (Acts 26: 12-20), and devote his life wholly to Christ’s Ministry as “the Lord’s freeman”. So, in February 1933, he resigned from the Government Service and became a full-time Minister of the gospel of Christ. This was quite in harmony with the biblical injunction, which says: “For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord’s freeman: Likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ’s servant. Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men ” – 1 Corinthians 7: 22, 23.
        
        The resignation of Brother G. M. Urhobo from the civil service for no other reason than that he, being anointed by the Lord, was going to give his whole time to God’s Kingdom service, gave cause for his own relatives and many of his colleagues and friends to view his sanity with suspicion. It was really difficult for the unspiritual to appreciate his decision and course of action in throwing to the winds, for the love of preaching as some said, such an enviable post in the Government Service in those days when men of his social rank were regarded as the elites of society!
        
         
        
        Right from the start of his career as a preacher, Brother Urhobo became an object of hatred and reproach as Christ truly said would happen to the chosen ones. (John 15: 18, 19; 17: 14-16). His relatives and friends forsook him. Some said he was mad; others called him a devil and deceiver just as Jesus Christ, the Redeemer of mankind, was called. (John 10: 20). Many false reports about him were published and circulated by certain people and the Watchtower Society warning the people to avoid him because of his teachings, which they considered to be revolutionary.
        
         
        
        His worst antagonists were among the members of the Watchtower Society and the Roman Catholic Church
        
         
        
        Owing to the persecution in Warri he went to Sapele in June 1933. There, too, it was not all roses for him. His expository lectures in which he criticised the false doctrines of “churchianity” stirred great enmity of the clergymen against him
        
         
        
        Urhobo vs Brown
        
        In October 1934, Brother Urhobo went to Lagos where, owing to his interest in the publications of the late J. F. Rutherford – former President of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of America-he came in contact with the late W. R. Brown, the local representative of the Watchtower Society in Nigeria.
        
         
        
        Later on, there was a disagreement between Brother Urhobo and Mr. Brown over the issues of doctrine. Brother Urhobo had in a biblically constructive argument, for the purpose of correction (2 Timothy 3: 16, 17), called the attention of Mr. Brown to certain errors in the teachings of the Watchtower Society about “Marriage”, “Jehovah’s Organisation”, “Selection and ordination of the 144,000 Anointed Christians”, “Leadership”, “Memorial Supper”, “Women Preaching” and their fixing dates for “Armageddon”.
        
         
        
        Instead of Mr. Brown to allow the Spirit of Christ to dominate his reason as to consider the correction of Brother Urhobo from a scriptural stand-point, he lost his temper. Yes, King Solomon said, “He that is soon angry dealeth foolishly.” (Proverbs. 14: 17) And St. James stated, “For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.” – James. 1: 20.
        
         
        
        The honourable course open to Brother Urhobo was to part company with Mr. Brown whose teachings, he pointed out were inconsistent with the Scripture. It is those doctrinal issues that are the base of the vast gulf still existing between the God’s Kingdom Society and the Watchtower Society whose members call themselves” Jehovah’s Witnesses”.
        
         
        
        GKS Organised
        
        It was in Lagos in that same year 1934 Brother Urhobo, through his soul-stirring public lectures, attracted a handful of adherents whom he, through the Spirit of God, organised into a group of Bible students. And it was that group that has grown steadily by God’s grace, into thousands of Christians allover Nigeria and abroad, in spite of stiff opposition and tribulations of the devil and become a mighty Christian Organisation known, today, as GOD’S KINGDOM SOCIETY. This precisely fulfils the Bible: “A little one shall become a thousand, and a small one a strong nation: I the Lord will hasten it in his time.” – Isaiah. 60: 22; see also Matthew 13: 31, 32.
        
         
        
        The members of the Watchtower Society having failed in their attempt to hinder the progress of the GKS, resorted to a campaign of callumny. They called Brother Urhobo a devil, Judas, man of sin, thief, prisoner, a withered branch, and such like contrary to the Bible. (Matthew 5: 43-45) They are not ashamed that the man whom they always called a “withered branch” was more virile in preaching the gospel than they; and the GKS, which is the fruit of his labour, continues to grow by leaps and bounds through the grace of God in fulfilment of the Bible. – Psalm 105: 24; 115: 11, 13-15; Isaiah. 9: 6, 7.
        
         
        
        We are sometimes amused when we hear some people talk glibly about the God’s Kingdom Society. They ask, “How can it be the church of God when it was founded by man?” They add, “The GKS sprang from the Watchtower Society; we knew the founder very well: it was the late G. M. Urhobo who was an ordinary postal clerk.”
        
         
        
        It is those who have no spiritual understanding that look down on the work of God on carnal or worldly considerations. We do not know of any church denomination, we reiterate, that God Himself came down from heaven to establish on earth. The Roman Catholic Church cannot make such a claim. Even their claim that it was founded by St. Peter is scripturally unsustainable. Historically, the influence of pagan Rome on that church is common knowledge. We need not go into details as to why people who had no spiritual light became “rulers of the church from outside”.
        
         
        
        The Church of England split or sprang from the Roman Catholic Church. Under Henry VIII, the break with the papacy became complete.
        
         
        
        The Lutherans started with Martin Luther and the Presbyterians with John Calvin. And was it not John Wesley, after graduation and ordination as a priest in the Church of England, that founded the Methodist Church? What about the Salvation Army? Was it not founded by William Booth, a Methodist minister, in the East End of London in 1865?
        
         
        
        Are the Baptists not successors of the Anabaptists who seceded formally from the Church of England in 1633. and “among their early and most distinguished names are those of Milton and Bunyan”? (Vide Jack’ s Reference Book, page 839).
        
         
        
        The Adventists of which the Seventh- Dav Adventists is just a body, started in North America with William Miller, a Baptist minister.
        
        Russell vs Barbour
        
        Finally, let us take a look at the Watchtower Society whose members are most vociferous in making bombastic claims and scandalising others. They claim that theirs is “Jehovah’s Organsation”, but who founded it? It was founded by Charles Taze Russell at Pittsburgh, Pa., in America. And what was he before then? A Watchtower publication, Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Divine Purpose, has this to say: “Russell was in partnership with his father, assisting him with his business activity in a men’s furnishing store…he abandoned it all to devote his entire time to the ministry,” (Page 17).
        
         
        
        The book stated that “in 1876, while Pastor Russell was in Philadelphia on a business trip, he happened to come into possession of a copy of the magazine The Herald of the Morning” being published by N. H. Barbour of Rochester. N. Y. He was pleased and interested because of the similarity of their views “even though be recognized it as an Adventist paper”. He got in touch with Barbour to arrange a meeting at his (Russell’s) expense in order to discuss matters. “He was satisfied with the evidence Barbour presented.” The book continues; “As a result of Russell’s meeting with Barbour, his study group in Pittsburgh became affiliated with the group at Rochester…” (Page 18)
        
         
        
        It is interesting to note that a division soon arose between Russell and Barbour because of differences on scriptural points. This resulted in Russell’s breaking away, The Watchtower publication quotes Russell as stating among other things; “Therefore, after a most careful though unavailing effort to reclaim the erring, I withdrew entirely from The Herald of the Morning, and from further fellowship with Mr., Barbour.” (Pages 20-21, emphasis ours).
        
         
        
        What moral right, therefore, have the Watchtower witnesses to point accusing fingers at Brother G. M. Urhobo for parting company with Mr. Brown and the Watchtower Society on doctrinal grounds?
        
         
        
        However, the point we are making in our reference to other religious bodies is that none of them is in a better position than the God’s Kingdom Society to claim to be God’s Organisation. But judged by the standard of morals, disciple and, above all, the preaching of the truth of God as contained in the Bible, we, like St. Paul recommend the GKS to “every man’s conscience in the sight of God”. The GKS does not, however, claim to be the only true church organisation in the whole world. We say all this not out of ill-will or animosity but for the purpose of enlightenment.
        
         
        
        The fact that Brother Gideon Urhobo was an African or a postal clerk was no reason why God would not use him to do His work. Late President Rutherford of the Watchtower Society stated in his booklet, Favored People, that the blessings of God have no reference whatsoever to nationalities;. He wrote: “The blackest man from Africa will have the same opportunity as the white man of America. ” (Page 7).
        
         
        
        The early apostles of Jesus Christ were common men but it pleased God to make them His workmen. If God could choose a fisherman to be an apostle, is it a postal clerk He could not call to labour in the gospel? (Matthew 4:18-22; Acts 4; 13) There is a popular hymn having this stanza:
        
        Not many rich or noble called,
        
        Not many great or wise;
        
        Those whom God makes His kings and priests
        
        Are poor in human eyes.
        
         
        
        This was drawn from the first epistle of St. Pauls to the Corinthians in which he made it clear that it is those the world regards as foolish and base God chooses to do His work. He wrote: “For ye see your calling, brethren, bow that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called: but God hath chosen the – foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; and base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are: that no flesh should glory in His presence.” – 1 Corinthians 1: 26-29.
        
         
        
        So when some people say contemptuously that the first President of the GKS did not go to Europe or America or university, we do not bother ourselves because we know that they are spiritually ignorant. The reproaches, malicious misrepresentations, slanders and persecutions of men have never stayed God’s blessings from descending upon the GKS. St. Paul was so reproached and branded a heretic, yet he told Felix: “But this I confess unto thee that after the way which they (his accusers) call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets.” – Acts 24: 14.
        
         
        
        Success.
        
        The success of Brother Gideon Urhobo is no longer in dispute. Today the God’s Kingdom Society, no matter whatever view anyone holds, reflects the glory of God and stands as an everlasting monument, by the grace of God, of Brother Gideon M. Urhobo-an illustrious son of Africa!
        
         
        
        With regard to the mission of the GKS, the following extracts from her Constitution are explicit enough:
        
        “(a) To declare God’s Kingdom of righteousness and peace on earth and to express this doctrine in every conceivable way and form, within the bounds of law, order and human decency and to do so at any time or place, to the best of our knowledge and understanding of Bible interpretations and symbolism.
        
        “(b) To vindicate, admonish, preach and impart to mankind irrespective of colour, creed or caste the wholesome idea of service, fear, adoration and reverence to God Almighty, the Maker of Man, the Author of Life, and the Great Ruler and Architect of the Universe, and for this purpose always to organise meetings and gatherings in any corner of the street, road, house or premises, in any township, village or locality without harm, violence nor damage to any person or property and without infringement of any laws or regulations of any constitutional authority of Government.
        
        “(c) To excite the interest of Africans and all peoples of the earth to the study of the Holy Bible, the Christian ethics and theology and to promote all means and measures conducive to the propagation of this knowledge for the eventual peace and realisation of harmony and tranquility among all people of the human race in accordance with scriptural ideology.”
        
         
        
        We have published this in the interest of the readers who have been asking to know more about the God’s Kingdom Society. Yes, the GKS is planted by God; it is not the work of man. Therefore, anyone persecuting her is “fighting against God”. – Acts 5: 29-42; Luke 10: 16; Mark 9: 41, 42; Hebrews 10: 31; 12: 29.`, 
        title:"HOW WAS THE GKS FOUNDED? "},
     {key:24, 
        content:`THE union of a man and a woman as husband and wife is known as marriage. It was instituted by the Almighty God not only for the accomplishment of His purpose but also for the benefit of men and women. In all the ways human beings have connections there is none – apart from the point of faith – the ties of which are stronger than the marriage bond.
    
        According to the Holy Bible, both man and woman are the creation of the Most High. From ‘the dust of the ground’, He made the first man Adam in His own image and endowed him with the attributes of wisdom, power, justice and love. And God said: “It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.” – Genesis 2: 18.

        It is worthy of note that the Omniscient, who knows the end from the beginning, took to a different process in bringing the woman into existence. He caused Adam to fall into a deep sleep, and took out one of his ribs to make a woman whom He gave to Adam to be his wife. Adam, having awaked out of sleep, did not vacillate between two opinions as to his fleshly connection with his wife but straight off he identified her saying: “This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.” – Genesis 2: 21-23.
        
   
        Thus Adam and Eve became the first human couple from whom the entire race of mankind descended. It is the will of God that the marital union should be kept sacred from infraction and that its strength should be maintained at all times. For this reason, it is written: “Therefore shall a man (for the sake of marriage) leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh. ” – Genesis 2: 24.
   
        We have now seen how marriage originated. Since then men and women have been marrying as ordained by the Lord. And because of the importance He attaches to marriage He enacted laws to regulate it. The law, according to Leviticus chapter 18, forbids a man from contracting marriage with a woman who is his near relation.
     
        The two principal reasons why God made the woman for the man and allowed them to get married, are (1) that the woman should be a helper or partner of the man (Genesis 2: 20-24); and (2) that they both should multiply and fill the earth with children. – Genesis 1: 27, 28.
    
        It is very important that every man or woman understands the purpose of marriage as well as the position each one holds in the union. Many marriages have run upon the rocks and collapsed because the parties concerned lacked this understanding. They do not appreciate its
        
        sacredness.
        
        Equal Rights?
        
        Some people hold the wrong view that in a marriage contract both the man and the woman have equal rights. According to The American Peoples Encyclopedia (Vol. 12, page 1077), “American laws and customs have tended to greater and greater equality between husband and wife in the marriage contract.” This is very wrong.
    
        There was never a time God, Who instituted marriage, indicated that man and woman were equal partners. When Adam and Eve sinned God, in passing His sentence, told the woman: “I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.”- Genesis 3: 16.
       
        What is more, St. Paul stated: “But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man…. ” (1 Corinthians 11: 3).
        
        The married woman must acknowledge the man as her head and give him that due respect. She too is vested with some rights or privileges of respect, honour, and trust which the man, though as the head, is bound to acknowledge and show to her. (Read 1 Corinthians 11: 3-12) St. Paul further explained that it is the woman that God made for the man, and not the man for the woman. Man is the image of God but the woman is the glory of the man. The man, he said, cannot do without the woman as she too cannot do without the man whom God had made to be her ruler and head.
        
        For any woman, therefore, to claim equality with her husband in the face of these scriptural authorities is a clear case of presumptuousness-and it is a sin (Deuteronomy 17: 12, 13; Psalm 19: 13) the woman must not usurp authority over the man. – 1 Timothy 2: 11-14.
       
        On the other hand any man who is so spineless to the extent of subjecting himself to the domination of his wife, is acting contrary to the divine purpose. St. Paul stated positively that an effeminate-that is, a womanish man or a man ruled by his wife-has no place in the Kingdom of God. – 1 Corinthians 6: 9, 10.
      
        We have said earlier that a married woman deserves to be respected but this respect must not be carried to the extreme of turning the husband nearly to a house- boy. What some so-called gentlemen regard as an act of “respect for the Mistress” is sheer stupidity. Woman is not man’s equal. Patricia Fay Anderton, a London woman, was quite right when she stated: “God never intended men and women to be equal; He certainly never intended women to compete with men. A woman is the complement to man… comforting and caring for him, and her true place is by his side not as a working competitor.” (West African Pilot, April 13, 1957).
       
        Dignity
        
        Marriage in its true perspective enhances the prestige and dignity of both the man and the woman. It was King Solomon who said, “Whoso findeth a wife (the godly type) findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favour of the Lord.” (Proverbs. 18: 22) And St. Paul stated: “Marriage is honourable; let us all keep it so, and the marriage-bond inviolate; for God’s judgment will fall on fornicators and adulterers.” – Hebrews 13: 4. New English Bible.
     
        Some people consider marriage as obsolete. Since unmarried women are very many and they can get some of them to satisfy their lusts at any time, it is, in their opinion, unwise to get themselves tied in matrimony to particular women. Another reason why they hate to get married is that they do not want to shoulder the responsibilities marriage imposes on men.
        
        There are also the female counterparts of this sort of unprincipled men, who prefer a life of debauchery to that of honourable marriage. All of them, except they repent, stand condemned before God and before men of honour for allowing themselves to be used as tools by the devil in carrying out his will in opposition to God and constituting a menace to human societies. In the end, the fate of the lawless will be their lot. – l Timothy 1: 9-10; Romans 1: 28-32.
        
        With regard to young women St. Paul advised: “1 will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.” – l Timothy 5: 14.
      
        We must admit that the married life of certain people leaves much to be desired. What joy or comfort is in a marriage where the husband and wife behave like a cat and dog in the home? Some men are so high-tempered that for almost every misdeed of the wife, no matter how trivial, he is prepared to administer strokes of the cane or a heavy blow on her, or engage her in a fight. Similarly, some women are rude, very stubborn, like a devil incarnate, and ill mannered so that they count it as sport not only to irritate their husbands with abusive words and provocative conduct but also to invite them to open duels. Once a situation such as this becomes the order of the day in a married home then all that marriage stands for is gone.
      
        But the point is that the fault is not in the institution but on those misfits who neither understand the purpose of marriage nor appreciate the essence of the nuptial ties.
     
        Virtuous Woman
        
        A married woman who realises that she is a helper to her husband must do things to give him comfort and pleasure. She should show interest in her housework and should be humble, sober, discreet and chaste. (Titus 2: 4, 5) King Solomon said that a virtuous woman does not eat the bread of idleness, but is industrious; and she cares for her household so much that the evidence of her care is noticed in her husband among people. “She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness. Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her. ” – Proverbs. 31: 10 – 28.
      
        It was in view of all this, King Solomon also stated: “A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband: but she that maketh ashamed is as rottenness in his bones.” -Proverbs 12: 4.
       
        It is not education, offering of gifts to curry neither favour nor beauty that makes marriage a success but good manners based on the fear of God. “Favour is deceitful”, said Solomon, “and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised.”-Proverbs. 31: 30.
     
        In his admonition to married women St. Paul wrote: “Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the Church: and he is the saviour of the body. Therefore as the Church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.” -Ephesians 5: 22-24; see also Colossians. 3: 18; 1 Peter 3: 1-6.
      
        Although God said that the desire of the wife should come from the husband (Genesis 3: 16) that is no reason why the wife should be a spendthrift. She should be able to live according to the means and social status of her husband. The Bible says: “Every wise woman buildeth her house: but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands.” – Proverbs. 14: 1.
       
        Responsibilities
        
        On the part of the husband, marriage entails a lot of responsibilities. That is why a man must count the cost before plunging into it. The husband should be God-fearing, knowledgeable and understanding enough as to be able to rule his wife and control the affairs of his home.
       
        Husbands are required to love their wives, and they should not be bitter against them. (Colossians 3: 19) They should look after their wives well and nourish them in order to make them happy and appear decent: for the woman is the glory of the man. Said St. Paul: “Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the Church, and gave himself for it ….So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself. For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the Church.” – Ephesians 5: 25-29, 33.
       
        It is an offence for a man to oppress or maltreat his wife. The seriousness of this is underscored by the fact that the prayer of such a man will not be answered by God. St. Peter therefore admonished: “Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.” – 1 Peter 3: 7.
        
        With regard to the purpose of reproduction, it is important that a good understanding exists between the husband and the wife. St. Paul’s advice on this matter is enough. He stated: “The husband must give the wife what is due to her, and the wife equally must give the husband his due. The wife cannot claim her body as her own; it is her husband’s. Equally, the husband cannot claim his body as his own; it is his wife’s. Do not deny yourselves to one another, except when you agree upon a temporary abstinence in order to devote yourselves to prayer; afterwards you may come together again; otherwise for lack of self-control, you may be tempted by Satan.” (1 Corinthians 7:3-5, New English Bible) It is a SIN and an abuse of marriage honour for the wife to have love connection with a man who is not her husband; so too it is a sin for the husband to have sexual relation with any woman who is not his wife.
               
        European Custom
        
        In certain religious circles it is believed that a man and a woman are not properly married except a priest officiates at the marriage ceremony and the man gives the woman a ring. This is what some people call Christian marriage.
        
     
        According to the Book of Common Prayer, the “solemnization of matrimony” takes a process involving open declarations by both the priest and the parties contracting the marriage. At a stage, the priest delivers the ring to the man who puts it upon the fourth finger of the woman‟s left hand, saying:
        
        “With this ring I thee wed, with my body I thee worship,
        
        and with all my worldly goods I thee endow…”
        
        The word “worship” here is improper as it is very unscriptural. It is only God true Christians worship. The husband should not worship his wife and the wife must not worship her husband. In the Christian Religion, man does not worship man save God and Christ alone. – Matthew 4: 10; 20:20; Hebrews1: 5, 6.
        
         
        
        To say the least, this system of wedding with the ring and worshipping the wife is a European custom garnished with religious formalities. It is the tendency of the white missionaries in introducing some of their customs to their African adherents under the cloak of “Christianity” that makes certain Africans wrongly call Christianity the whiteman’s religion.
        
         
        
        We challenge anyone to cite a precedent in the Bible to show that a priest ever officiated at a marriage ceremony as the priests of “churchianity” are doing or that a ring has anything to do with the marriage of Christ’s disciples.
        
        There was a marriage feast in Cana of Galilee which Jesus Christ and his disciples attended in his days on earth. He did not perform any function of uniting people in a “holy wedlock”. All he did was his first miracle of turning water into wine. – John 2: 1-11.
        
         
        
        It is the responsibility of parents to give out their daughter to whom they will according to their own customs which do not contravene God’s laws.
        
         
        
        African Christians can marry according to their customs and Europeans, Americans or Asians according to theirs, provided those customs, we repeat, do not violate the laws of God. It is wrong for white missionaries to impose their customs on Africans in the name of Christianity. And for the African to ape the whiteman’s customs in the name of modernism is shameful. To despise any custom, which is not contrary to the Scriptures, just because it is African, is sinful. God is against despite. (Proverbs. 14: 21; 11: 12) African Christians can break their kola nuts and drink their palm wine during marriage negotiations and feasts; it is no sin. But they should not pour libations to the gods or ancestors. (Deuteronomy 6: 14,15) Christians have and serve one God-the Almighty God-through Jesus Christ. (1 Timothy 2: 5) Ancestors can neither help nor bless one’s marriage. The Bible says that the dead know not anything. – Ecclesiastes 9: 5,6.
        
         
        
        Church Role
        
        The role of the Church, which the pastor or any elder of the church can play, is to guide, advise and charge the contracting parties as regards the solemnity and sanctity of marriage which must be maintained in order not to contravene God’s laws and so that He (God) may bless the marriage.
        
         
        
        Before concluding, we must stress once again that the relationship between husband and wife must be kept inviolate. Neither the husband nor the wife has the right to break their marriage at will. They must not allow extraneous influence or unnecessary interference from parents, relatives or friends to disrupt their home. The saying that “they shall be one flesh” is but an emphasis signifying the strong relationship that must exist between husband and wife. Jesus Christ said: “What therefore God hath joined together let no man put asunder.” (Matthew 19: 4-6) And God said through St. Paul: “Let not the wife depart from her husband: but and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife.” – 1 Corinthians 7: 10, 11.
        
         
        
        What is important in marriage is not the joy and zest with which one enters into it but the understanding and ability to sustain it in the fear of God. Men and women should be educated and encouraged to marry, and to endeavour to build up a happy home to the Lord’s glory.
        
        The burning question as to whether it is lawful for a Christian to marry more than one wife shall, by the grace of God, be treated in the next issue of “The Weekly Sermon”.`,

        content:`THE Church of God, wherever it is established in any part of the world, is never divided but one in faith, fellowship, love and in preaching God’s word – the truth. Jesus Christ was fully aware that Christianity, which he founded by the power of God, would in process of time be counterfeited by some people at the instance of Satan, the arch-enemy of God and man. And so, he did not leave his disciples without setting out the marks by which his true Church could be identified.

        In the first place, we wish to correct the wrong view of some Christians who refer to a building as a church. One of the definitions given by The Catholic Encyclopedic Dictionary is that a church is “a place of Christian worship”. Very often we come across publications stating that a certain amount of money has been earmarked or contributed for the building of a church. Or that the foundation stone of a new church to be built at a cost of £10,000 or so, has been or is to be laid by such and such reverend gentleman. Also, we find some people pointing at a building and saying, “This is our church.”
      
        The Bible does not refer to a house as church. Neither Jesus Christ nor any of his early apostles used the word to mean a building or place of worship. It is because of the continuous wrong usage of the word by priests and theologians that makers of dictionaries have also been biased to misconstrue it in that regard.
            
        Christian
        
        According to the Scripture, the word church, which was translated from the Greek word ekklesia or ecclesia, means a congregation or body or an assembly of Christians. The word was first used by Jesus Christ as recorded in the eighteenth verse of the sixteenth chapter of the gospel according to St. Matthew. The occasion was when Jesus Christ asked his disciples certain questions, and Peter gave a correct answer. To Peter, he said: “Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven. And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.” – Matthew 16: 13-18.
      
        
        That the rock upon which the church is built is not Peter but Jesus Christ who himself is the head of the Church (1 Corinthians 10: 4; Colossians 1: 18) has been proved beyond argument in The Weekly Sermon (Vol. 1, No.9) issue of November 3, 1968. The point we are now making is that Jesus Christ did not use the word church to mean a literal house or place of worship.
    
        In the Acts of the Apostles, chapter 14, a lucid account is given about how Paul and Barnabas worked unitedly for the furtherance of the gospel of Christ. When they were come to Antioch as stated in verse 27, “and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how He had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles”. The church that was gathered means the Christians, collectively, (not houses) that were assembled! When St. Paul said that “it is a shame for women to speak in the church” (1 Corinthians 14: 34, 35) he was not making reference to a building set aside for worship but to a congregation of Christians
   
        Furthermore, St Paul wrote in his epistle to the Romans thus: “Likewise greet the church that is in their house… The churches of Christ salute you.” (Romans 16: 5, 16) Can anybody show that the apostle was asking his fellow Christians to greet a house? how can a sane person do that? it is unthinkable! Or can a house, an inanimate object, salute persons? it cannot, except a demon in it. This is just to show how ridiculous and meaningless it will sound if the word church is reduced to mean a place of worship.
 
        By the clause, “the church that is in their house”, St. Paul meant the disciples of Christ that met in their house. And when he stated “the churches of Christ salute you” he was referring to the congregations of Christian believers. See also 1 Corinthians 16: 19.
    
        
        It should be understood, therefore, that our reference to the “true Church” in the caption of this sermon, has to do with a group or body or a society of genuine Christians. The epithet true would have been superfluous if there had not existed groups of professed Christians which are counterfeit.
   
        
        Denominations
        
        With regard to the number of church denominations in the world, it is difficult to speak with exactitude. They are very many, and new ones spring up almost everyday. In Nigeria, there were two in particular that did not last long: they were the “Do Me I Do You Church” and “Adam and Eve Church”. The former was founded on the principle of retaliation as enunciated in the laws of Moses. Its members claimed that if they did not return evil for evil, God would be angry in that it was a sin. In the case of “Adam and Eve Church”, nakedness was their doctrine and practice. There is a similar church in England known as “The Guild Church of the Naturian Kindred”. (Vide Sunday Pictorial, May 19, 1957, page 15).
        
         
        
        Considering the degree of variance among the churches in doctrines and methods of worship, it will be a very silly conclusion to say that all of them belong to Jesus Christ and are serving the one true God.
        
         
        
        The Roman Catholic Church claims to be the only true Church, and mother of all others. In a pamphlet entitled, Can I Change My Religion? published by the “Catholic Truth Society” in London, it is stated: “Catholics do not want to change their religion, because they are quite sure that their religion is the true one…. You must accept everything that has been defined by her in the past, and be ready to accept without question anything that she may define in the future.” (Pages 3-4).
        
         
        
        Other church groups do disagree and pooh-pooh the claim of the Roman Catholics which cannot be supported with or proved from the Bible.
        
         
        
        There are some groups in Nigeria and elsewhere whose members’ activities, rather than turning men’s minds to God, are causing some people to reproach Christianity. In some of the groups almost every other member is either an apostle or a prophet or prophetess. Some take pride in high-sounding appellations such as “Senior Apostle”, “Most Senior Apostle” and so on. They prophesy and see visions almost everyday. The visions do not concern the purpose of God and are not such that tend to lead to righteousness but visions about riches or of the women the “spirit” wants them to marry, or of who is a witch and what not.
        
         
        
        It is common knowledge that fornication and adultery are perpetrated in some of these mushroom groups where certain prophets can spend a whole day with women in private rooms under the cover of prayer! Some of these prophets take certain deluded women to rivers where they pretend to wash away their sins and to invoke angels through prayer to drive away devils or demons from them. It is frequently alleged that the prophets strip them stark naked and make immoral advances to them in “holy” water!
        
         
        
        It was during one of their spirit-vision expeditions that some of these prophets killed a certain poor woman in the Western State as published.
        
         
        
        The other day one of their prophets claimed to have seen a vision that the Western State of Nigeria would sink if the people paid more than 7/6 per head as tax; he actually went out to spread this satan-inspired message. But on investigation, it was discovered that the anti-tax preacher had himself paid tax and kept his receipt quite intact. He was of course, justly convicted for 18 months. (Daily Times, February 1, 1969) Since Jesus Christ and his disciples paid tax in his days, do we still need any more proof before we can know that the anti-tax gospeler is a fake?
        
         
        
        Variance
        
        All the churches cannot be true while they are at variance on several points of doctrine, and divided in their methods of worship, we repeat. St. Paul stated: “Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.” (1 Corinthians 1: 10) The fact that some have deviated from the truth of God in the Bible and do not speak the same thing and are divided leaves no room for doubt that such ones only call the name of Christ in pretence.
        
         
        
        False Prophets
        
        Jesus Christ knew very well that false prophets with their characteristic propensity for fantastic claims would proliferate in this age of the last day, and he warned against them. Said he: “And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many. For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect. Behold, I have told you before.” (Matthew 24: 11, 24-25.) Bible students are not surprised to see them and hear of them all over the world. It is a proof that the last day is here!
        
         
        
        Within the past few years the rate at which false Christs sprang up is fantastic. Like a shooting star, they appear suddenly in the mood of sanctimoniousness and, after a short while, fade away into oblivion. Where now is the “Jesus of Oyingbo” (Lagos)? Where is that of France who predicted that the world would end on August 15, 1954? (Vide the Illustrated of May, 1954) and where is that “Jesus of Ogbunike” near Onitsha? One of them claimed to be God and the very Jesus the Son of God, and at the same time he said he was Abraham. Yet some of those who had been stupefied with the strokes of his cane by which he “baptised” his adherents, believed everything he said. God said: “A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land; the prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love to have it so: and what will ye do in the end thereof?” – Jeremiah 5: 30, 31.
        
         
        
        There is no doubt that Nigeria, and the world at large, is in danger of false prophets. They are dangerous because they lead people to destruction. – Isaiah. 9: 16; Matthew 15: 12-14.
        
         
        
        When we examine the root of the encomium or praise and the credit given to certain churches for their achievements we find that they do not relate to the purity of doctrine or the reformation of character in converted souls. Rather, such a praise or credit is based on the number of schools, colleges or hospitals they have established or on the scholarships they have given to people. These institutions are not bad. But they are no standards or qualities by which genuine Christianity can be distinguished. The most important thing is the preaching of the truth of God’s word – the gospel – to the sheep of God so that they may be free from Satan’s works and be saved in God’s Kingdom. – Mark 16: 15-16, 19-20; John 8: 31, 32, 36.
        
         
        
        The pride of certain churches is that they have existed for a very long time. Because of this they regard others which are not as old to be false. On this, we also hold the view that it is not how long but how well. Jesus did say: “But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.” – Matthew 19: 30.
        
         
        
        In order to know which church is true and which is not, we must examine the doctrines and practices of the various groups – using the Holy Bible as our yardstick. Jesus gave this warning: “Beware of false teachers, who come disguised as harmless sheep but are wolves and will tear you apart. You can detect them by the way they act, just as you can identify a tree by its fruit. You need never confuse grapevines with thorn bushes! Or figs with thistles! Different kinds of fruit trees can quickly be identified by examining their fruit. For a variety producing delicious fruit doesn’t produce a kind that is inedible! And a tree producing an inedible variety can’t produce what is good! So the trees having the inedible fruit are chopped down and thrown on the fire. Yes, the way to identify a tree, or a person, is by the kind of fruit produced.” – Matthew 7: 15-20, Living Gospels.
        
         
        
        The Authorised Version puts verse 20 thus: “Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.” Jesus Christ further said: “Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.” -Matthew 7: 21.
        
         
        
        It is wrong, therefore, to accept every church denomination as true and as belonging to Jesus Christ. We must follow strictly the guidelines given in the Scriptures in order not to be deceived especially in these days when many are claiming to be prophets, apostles and prophetesses who see spirits. John the apostle admonished: “Beloved. believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone on into the world.” (1 John 4: 1) And St. Paul also warned: “Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.” – l Thessalonians 5: 21.
        
         
        
        To close our eyes to or ignore the reality of the presence of false churches among us is nothing but self-deceit. Said St. Paul; “Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron; forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth…. ” (1 Timothy 4; 1-5.) Just look around, it will not take you any pains to find the church groups that come under the category of the apostle’s predictive description.
        
         
        
        True Church
        
        The fruit by which we can know the true Church is not the doing of wonders, seeing of visions, dreaming of dreams or the saying of many prayers but the preaching of the TRUTH in particular, and the showing of Christian love. (John 13: 34,35) False prophets can do wonders, see visions and do some other things, but they CAN NEVER preach the TRUTH without adulterating it. (Matthew 7: 20-23) Once the doctrine of any religious body is tainted with a lie that group is not a true church. St. John stated “that no lie is of the truth”. (1 John 2: 21) It was on this ground St. Paul wrote to Timothy: “If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness; he is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings, perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself.” – 1 Timothy 6: 3-5.
        
         
        
        The trouble with many people is that they take things for granted. They do not care to ascertain whether what they are taught to believe in the churches are in harmony with the holy scripture. For example, the teaching that St. Peter is the head of the church is not true; JESUS CHRIST IS THE HEAD. (Ephesians 5: 22,23) The teaching that the soul is immortal is wrong; the baptism of infants is unchristian, and the teaching that baptism washes away sins is unscriptural; the teaching that women are ordained by God to preach the gospel is unbiblical. There are a lot of other false doctrines and beliefs which space will not permit us to mention here.
        
         
        
        Any church denomination, or even an angel from heaven, that teaches any doctrine unsupported in the Scripture, has no right to claim to be the true church. Said St. Paul: “But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed…” – Galatians 1: 8, 9.
        
         
        
        The true Church, therefore, is the Christian Organisation in any part of the world that preaches the truth, nothing but the whole truth, as contained in the Holy Bible. Jesus said to the Jews who believed on him: “If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.” (John 8: 31, 32) It is the truth that will bring us the salvation of God, but the absence of it means the loss of everything good.
        
         
        
        As we must be honest and true to ourselves and other persons of goodwill toward God, we cannot hide the fact that the God’s Kingdom Society (GKS) is preaching the truth which has enlightened many people and brought them God’s blessings; she is therefore -like any other church organisation preaching the truth-the true Church of Christ. Some may frown upon this claim but the onus of proof rests upon them to show from the Scriptures (not their opinions) that we are not. And where they cannot let them say, as commanded by God, “It is truth.”-Isaiah. 43: 9; see also John 8: 45, 46.`, 
        title:"IDENTIFYING THE TRUE CHURCH"},
     {key:27, 
        content:`THE view of some people that the Old Testament of the Bible has been done away with in the Christian Era is, to put it mildly, a misconception. Indeed, the advent of Jesus Christ brought about a modification of the Mosaic Law, yet, the change was not calculated to rule out the use of the Old Testament by Christians.

 

        The Old Testament (otherwise known as the Hebrew Scriptures) is the first of the two great divisions of the Holy Bible containing God’s covenants with man. It is made up of 39 books which are counted from Genesis to Malachi. The contents of the Old Testament include the accounts of the creation, the fall of man and the manifestation of God’s justice, the Deluge, the Abrahamic promise, the laws of Moses to the nation of Israel, other typical incidents of far-reaching spiritual significance, the psalms, proverbs and prophecies.
        
         
        
        Among those who profess to be Christians there are some who in their teachings discard the Old Testament and give their followers to understand that Christians have nothing to do with it in that it was intended to serve the natural Jews alone. For this reason, many people frown upon any reference to texts in the Old Testament.
        
         
        
        In a Bible Correspondence Course by the “Church of Christ” it is stated: “The Old Testament was God’s law to the Jew… It is most important for us to realize that God’s will for us is found in the New Testament-not in the Old.
        
        “Here are three reasons why we cannot today go to the Old Testament to find what God requires of us: (1) The Old Testament was God’s law to the Jew. You were never under it. The ten commandments were given to the Jew only -never to the Gentiles (Read Exodus, chapters 19 and 20.) You cannot break the ten commandments any more than you can break the law of China. You are not and never were under them. (2) The Old Testament never contained a plan of salvation, not even for the Jew. At best, all he could do with his sacrifices was to postpone the punishment for his sins for a year. His sacrifices could not take away sin. (3) You are not under the Old Testament because Jesus took the law of Moses out of the way at his death. ‘He taketh away the old (covenant) that he might establish the new (covenant) by the which will we are sanctified’. (Hebrews 10: 10)”
        
         
        
        The foregoing quotes, no doubt, represent the argument of those who hold the view that the Old Testament is out of date.
        
         
        
        Law and Prophets
        
        In the first place it is very wrong to equate the Old Testament with the Ten Commandments contained in the twentieth chapter of the book of Exodus. As we indicated earlier in this sermon, the Old Testament contains much more than just “God’s law to the Jew”. Jesus Christ referred to the Old Testament as “the law and the prophets” during his ministry on earth. (Matthew 5: 17; 11: 13; Luke 16: 16) When Jesus was addressing his disciples after his resurrection, he declared: “These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms concerning me.” The account goes on, “Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures.” – Luke 24: 44,45.
        
         
        
        It is very misleading, therefore, to give the impression that the Ten Commandments are the only fundamentals conveyed in the Old Testament! The Scriptures which Christ opened the minds of his disciples to understand were not only the Ten Commandments. They included the prophets and the psalms as well.
        
         
        
        The Old Testament is so linked with the New in such a flow of divine thoughts, symbolisms and rules that no true Christian can dispense with a thorough understanding of its significance. Christians are bound to believe the Old Testament but their belief must be backed with a good understanding of the modification of the law through the grace and truth that came by Jesus Christ. – John 1: 17.
        
         
        
        St. Paul confessed before Governor Felix that he believed the Old Testament which he referred to as “the law and the prophets”. He said: “But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they (the Jews who accused him) call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets.” – Acts 24: 14.
        
         
        
        Eternal Life
        
        The second point that “the Old Testament never contained a plan of salvation, not even for the Jews”, is a clear manifestation of lack of spiritual understanding. It is another way of saying that all those who lived before Christ would not be saved. The Bible does not support this view. In Hebrews chapter 11, there is a catalogue of some of the ancient faithful who had received God’s approval to inherit His everlasting perfect Kingdom.
        
         
        
        As far back as the days of Abraham the Almighty God disclosed His purpose of the salvation of mankind. To Abraham He said: “In thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed.” (Genesis 12: 3; 22: 18) It was in order to accomplish this magnificent purpose of blessing mankind-not only the believing Jews but the converted Gentiles also – with life, peace and happiness everlastingly that God sent Jesus Christ to the world. Concerning this St. Paul stated: “And Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles through faith, declared the Gospel to Abraham beforehand: ‘In you all nations shall find blessing.‟ Thus it is the men of faith who share the blessing with faithful Abraham.” – Galatians 3: 8, 9. (New English Bible)
        
         
        
        Space will fail us to expatiate on the significance of the prophecy of Moses concerning Jesus Christ whom he warned the Jews to obey. (Deuteronomy 18: 15; Acts 3: 23) What about Job’s declaration? “For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: and though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God.” (Job. 19: 25-27) Could a man who had no knowledge of “God’s plan of salvation” speak in such a vein that reflected true confidence and faith in the resurrection of the dead with- out which the faith of Christians is vain?
        
         
        
        A question-and-answer conversation between a lawyer and Jesus Christ in his days on earth, throws a ray of light on this matter. The lawyer put this test question to him: “Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?” Jesus countered him with questions: “What is written in the law? how readest thou?” The law expert then answered: “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.” (The lawyer quoted from Deuteronomy 6: 5 and Leviticus. 19: 18.) And Jesus told him: “Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.” – Luke 10: 25- 28.
        
         
        
        On another occasion when a certain ruler asked Jesus Christ as to what he should do in order to inherit eternal life, he (Jesus) told him: “Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.” (Luke 18: 18-20) The point is that, if the laws were not necessary for salvation why did Christ refer to them? Mark you, the question was about salvation or eternal life. Will the anti-Old Testament preachers say that the book of Luke is in the Old Testament? Must Christians steal, commit adultery or bear false witness against people because the laws were for the Jews only?
        
         
        
        St. Paul stated firmly that the “commandment was ordained to life” and added, “Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good”. It is sin in men that makes them unable to keep the perfect laws of God. (Romans 7: 7-17) St. Paul believed the writings of Moses and quoted him as saying, “That the man which doeth those things (of the law) shall live by them.” (Romans 10: 5; see also Leviticus 18: 5; Nehemiah 9: 29; Galatians 3: 12).
        
         
        
        The usefulness of the Old Testament to Christians is further portrayed in St. Paul’s epistle to the Romans. He said: “For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for OUR learning, that WE (Christians) through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hop e.” (Romans 15: 4.) Can any Christian of today claim to be a better authority than St. Paul, the vastly talented apostle? He also said: “For we are saved by hope…” (Romans 8: 24, 25) This is the hope which we have through “the comfort of the scriptures” about which the apostle was referring to the Old Testament.
        
         
        
        With regard to the third point that the law of Moses was taken out of the way at the death of Jesus Christ we agree; but only to the extent of the understanding of what in effect was taken out of the way or the proper spiritual understanding of what that implies. St. Paul stated without ambiguity that there was a change of the law consequent upon the change of the priesthood from the Aaronic system to the priesthood after the order of Melchizedec. It is this change that enabled Jesus Christ who sprang from the tribe of Judah to become a priest. But under the Law of Moses only the sons of Aaron from the tribe of Levi were qualified for the priesthood. – Read Hebrews 7: 11-19.
        
         
        
        We must point out that this change of the priesthood and the law cannot be taken to mean the abolition of the Old Testament. The laws cancelled were those that were a shadow of things to come, many of which Christ had fulfilled, and those laws which stood against our nature such as relating to meat, drink, holyday, new moon and sabbath days.- Colossians 2: 14-17; Hebrews 10: 1-10.
        
         
        
        It must be understood that the Ten Commandments were not the only laws of Moses; there were several others. Many of these laws are still effective up till now save that they are underlined by the grace of Christ through faith which permits of observing the spirit rather than the letters of the law. The apostles commanded the Christians not to eat blood or things strangled according to Acts 15: 28, 29. But these were some of the Old Testament laws though not among the Ten Commandments.
        
         
        
        Amendment
        
        The opinion that the Old Testament is condemned has no basis in the Scriptures. Jesus Christ himself said: “Do not suppose that I have come to abolish the Law and the prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to complete. I tell you this: so long as heaven and earth endure, not a letter, not a stroke, will disappear from the Law until all that must happen has happened. If any man therefore sets aside even the least of the Law’s demands, and teaches others to do the same, he will have the lowest place in the kingdom of Heaven, whereas anyone who keeps the Law and teaches others so will stand high in the kingdom of Heaven.” – Matthew 5: 17-19. (New English Bible).
        
         
        
        Even in modifying the laws Christ increased the degree of their strength. Some of the amendments of the Law by Christ are written in Matthew 5: 21-48. Here are few instances. He said to his disciples: “Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment: but I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of judgment…” (Matthew 5: 21, 22) By this amendment, it is not only when you commit murder that you become guilty but as soon as you nurse anger against your neighbour without cause you are in danger of judgment.
        
         
        
        Again, Jesus said: “Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery. But I say unto you, whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.”(Matthew 5: 27, 28) In fact, some of the amendments are additions which place the old laws on a firmer footing in the Christian Era.
        
         
        
        There are numerous Old Testament quotations in the New Testament. Both Jesus Christ and his early apostles made references to texts in the Old Testament to support their statements. When Satan tempted Jesus Christ to get food by changing stones into bread so as to prove that he was the Son of God, it was the Old Testament Christ quoted to counter the devil. For Jesus said: “It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.” (Matthew 4: 3, 4) To be precise, Christ quoted Deuteronomy 8: 3. On that occasion, the devil also cited the Hebrew Scriptures (Old Testament) which he twisted, as false prophets do, to suit his purpose, but Jesus Christ silenced him with genuine authorities quoted from the same Old Testament. (Matthew 4: 5-11).
        
         
        
        St. Peter also quoted the Psalms of David (Psalm 41: 9; 69: 25; 109: 8) when he was addressing the disciples about Judas Iscariot, the traitor, whose office another was to take. -Acts 1: 15-20.
        
         
        
        In most of St. Paul’s epistles he made references to the Hebrew Scriptures. Exhorting the Roman Christians, he said: “Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.” (Romans 12: 19) The apostle cited from Deuteronomy 32: 35. And in Romans 14: 11, he further cited from Isaiah 45: 23.
        
         
        
        Instances of references made by Jesus Christ and the apostles to Old Testament texts are numerous and all cannot be cited here. But from the few of them shown in the foregoing it will be preposterous for anyone to insist still that the Old Testament is of no use to Christians.
        
        In first Corinthians chapter 10, St. Paul outlined some of the experiences and doings of the children of Israel. He stated that God was not well pleased with many of them because of their iniquities and they were overthrown in the wilderness. He then added: “Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.” – 1 Corinthians 10: 11.
        
         
        
        If we the Christians now at the end of the world are to do away with the Old Testament. how can what is written in it be “for our admonition”? In other words, how can we understand the spiritual import of those incidents and learn lessons from them?
        
         
        
        Law of Liberty
        
        Some people quarrel with the Old Testament because of their lack of understanding in regard to the change of the Mosaic Law. Christians are expected to live a holy life; this calls for the practice of righteousness by adhering to the demands of God’s word or law of liberty which purifies the worshipper who sincerely acknowledges and puts away his sins. – Acts 10: 34,35; Matthew 5: 20; 6: 33; James. 1:25; 2:12.
        
         
        
        We do not by this ignore the fact that it is by God’s grace through faith that Christians will be saved. Asked St. Paul: “Do we then make void the law through faith?” He himself answered: “God forbid: yea, we establish the law.” – Romans 3: 31.
        
         
        
        If we know how to use the laws, we will never under-estimate their value. It was St. Paul who said “But we know that the law is good if a man use it lawfulIy.” – 1 Timothy 1: 8.
        
         
        
        The truth of the subject matter has been made plain. Anyone who believes in the New Testament must equally believe in the Old because the New testifies to the vital importance, reliability and indispensability of the Old Testament. It is both the Old and New that make up “all Scripture” which St. Paul says “is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine for reproof, for correction in righteousness: that the man of God may be perfect throughly furnished unto all good works.” (2 Timothy 3: 16, 17) And remember that Jesus Christ said he came not to destroy the law or the prophets but to fulfill and complete their works. – Matthew 5: 17-19.`, 
        title:"IS THE OLD TESTAMENT ABOLISHED?"},
     {key:28, 
        content:`FOR reasons purely spiritual, the God’s Kingdom Society (GKS) observes neither “Good Friday” nor Easter. The appellation of “good” by which the day of Christ‟s passion and ignominious death is identified is irreconcilable with scriptural facts. And Easter, which is derived from paganism, ought not to be associated with Christianity at all!

 

        Good Friday is the Friday before Easter Sunday which is observed by the Churches of Christendom in commemoration of the death of Jesus Christ. According to the Catholic Dictionary, “It is, of course, a day of fasting, abstinence and penitence…. It is the only day of the year upon which Mass may not be said.”
        
         
        
        Ceremonies
        
        The religious observance of “Good Friday” is marked with ceremonies which are reminiscent of the deep sorrow and depressed state of the disciples of Jesus Christ during the period of his suffering and death. On this occasion a three-hour service is usually held with the altars stripped of decorations, the candles unlit and the priests dressed in black robes. During the protracted service, the successive stages of the passion are recalled in the liturgical ceremonies with all the accompaniments of the deepest and tenderest mourning.
        
         
        
        There is no doubt that the death of Jesus Christ was a remarkable event in human history. Although Satan the devil, with evil intention, inspired it, God Almighty in His infinite mercy turned it to the good of mankind in pursuance of His purpose of salvation.
        
         
        
        The day is qualified as “good” because, according to the clergy, it was on that day Jesus Christ our Redeemer obtained salvation for fallen mankind. This assumption, in men’s often faulty opinion or reasoning, appears to be reasonable but viewed against the background of the Scriptures it cannot be justified.
        
         
        
        To those who were the enemies of truth and righteousness in the days of Jesus, that day of his crucifixion was good. It was the day they saw the fulfillment of their conspiracy. Their joy was not because they realised or believed that his death was for the redemption of sinful mankind; rather they hoped that it would mean the end of the man whom they called a “deceiver”.
        
         
        
        Anyone who reads the Bible well will find no difficulty in seeing the contrast between the disposition of the wicked Jews who were the enemies of light and the state of mind of Jesus Christ and his disciples at the time of the crucifixion. While the conspirators revelled in their acts of atrocity, Jesus Christ whose innocence was not in dispute, as well as his followers, was grief-striken.
        
         
        
        Sorrow
        
        Before the arrest of Jesus, he had forewarned his disciples concerning the events which would result in anxious moments and distress for them. He told them pointblank that they would be plunged into sorrow and that the world would rejoice, yet he gave the assurance that their sorrow would revert to joy. Said he: “A little while, and ye shall not see me because I go to the Father.” His disciples did not understand what he meant, and when he realised that they wanted to know the meaning of his statement, he declared: “Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy” – John 16: 16-20.
        
         
        
        On the part of Jesus Christ himself, he knew that the hour for him to bear the griefs of mankind had struck and he was prepared to submit to his Father’s will and damn the consequence of the worst his foes could do. Yet in an outburst of human feeling, he said to Peter, James and John: “My soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death….” (Matthew 26: 38) He moved forward a little from them and fell on his face in prayer, saying “O My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless not as I will, but as Thou wilt.” (Matthew 26: 39) Then he returned to the three disciples and found them asleep, exhausted from grief. – Luke 22: 45.
        
         
        
        From all indications, this was a very trying moment for Jesus Christ and his disciples. He was in such agony of spirit that his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground. It was in this state he went away again the second time, and prayed: “O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, Thy will be done.” (Matthew 26: 42) The upshot of the whole affair proved that it was the Father’s will that he should drink the cup, and so “taste death for every man” – Hebrews 2: 9.
        
         
        
        It is on record that the disciples of Jesus Christ continued to be under the grip of sorrow until the gladsome news of his resurrection was broken to them. – Mark 16: 9, 10.
        
         
        
        In the light of the foregoing facts dished up out of the Scriptures, it does not stand to reason for those on the side of Christ to call or regard that day of his anguish and death as good. If it is a good day all because the death of Christ redounded to man’s salvation, why do “church-goers” indulge in fasting, abstinence, wearing of black robes and in ceremonies suggestive of mourning on “Good Friday”? Why do they not go about merry-making?
        
         
        
        Concerning “Good Friday”, Benjamin Vincent in his Haydn’s Dictionary of Dates and Universal Information stated: “Its appellation of good appears to be peculiar to the church of England; our Saxon forefathers denominated it Long Friday: on account of the length of the offices and fastings enjoined on this day.” (Page 448)
        
         
        
        Judas Iscariot
        
        On the other hand, can it not be taken to mean that those who regard the day of Christ’s crucifixion as good are in effect giving support, wittingly or unwittingly, to his betrayer and all the evil men who contributed to his death? Was the killing of Jesus Christ a good act? It was not! But if we go by the trend of reasoning of the clergy, then they themselves cannot stand any ground against the sceptics who justify Judas Iscariot for betraying our Lord and Saviour into the hands of sinners.
        
         
        
        The Holy Bible is quite clear on the point that Judas Iscariot was condemned because he sinned against the Holy Spirit by betraying innocent blood. And the consequence was grievous. He was deposed from his high office of heavenly calling and was stamped with the ominous title of the “son of perdition.” – John 17: 6, 12.
        
         
        
        Jesus Christ had long ago been resurrected and glorified by the Almighty Father- never to die again! He himself said: “I am he that liveth, and was dead; and behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.” (Revelation 1: 18) To indulge in fasting and mourning still for the risen and glorified Lord, as certain Churches are doing, is not only unnecessary but also contrary to the principles of Christianity. Jesus did not say that his followers would mourn for ever, rather he said, “your sorrow shall be turned into joy”. And he added: “Your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh away.” (John 16: 19-22) This he said because he knew that his resurrection would be victory over death and that it would strengthen the faith of Christians and give them cause for great joy. The Churches are therefore not justified for their “Good Friday” abstinence, mourning and formalities.
        
         
        
        St. Paul in his epistle to the Thessalonians, exhorted the Christians about the dead thus: “But would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. Wherefore comfort one another with these words.” – 1 Thessalonians 4: 13-14, 18.
        
         
        
        The point we are making is this, if we are not to be in sorrow for those who die in the Lord because of the hope of resurrection, is there any reason why anyone should mourn for Jesus Christ -the author of that hope – who had since been raised from the dead?
        
         
        
        Let no one, therefore, deceive himself as to think that all his self-afflictions and mourning of “Good Friday” are of any spiritual significance before God and Christ.
        
         
        
        Easter
        
        With regard to Easter festival, the fact that it originated from paganism cannot be disputed. Students of ecclesiastical history are sometimes baffled as to why those who claimed to be the successors of the apostles and custodians of God’s word after the death of the early apostles of Jesus Christ should with relish adopt pagan institutions, customs and practices.
        
         
        
        Easter was a pagan festival originally celebrated by the Anglo-Saxons in the spring equinox in honour of a Teutonic goddess known as Astarte or Eostre. The well known ecclesiastical historian, Alexander Hislop, in his book, The Two Babylons, stated that Easter “is not a Christian name”. He went on, “It bears its Chaldean origin on its very forehead. Easter is nothing else than Astarte, one of the titles of Beltis, the queen of heaven…. That name as found by Layard on the Assyrian monuments, is Ishtar…. The festival, of which we read in Church history under the name Easter, in the third or fourth centuries, was quite a different festival from that now observed in the Romish Church, and at that time was not known by any such name as Easter. It was called the Pasch, or the Passover ” (Pages 103-104).
        
         
        
        The use of “hot cross buns” and “dyed eggs” as a custom that still attends the celebration of Easter is but a confirmation of the testimony of history as to its origin. The illustrated World Encyclopedia has this to say: “Before the time of Christ people used to worship many gods and goddesses. One was named Eastre. Because Easter comes in the spring, we have named it for this goddess. We have brightly colored eggs at Easter, because eggs stand for the beginning, or birth, just as spring itself is a birth each year. Christians celebrated Easter as the New Year . . .” (Vol. 7, page 1732).
        
         
        
        Mistranslation
        
        The word Easter appears once in the Holy Bible at Acts 12: 4. All accredited scholars agree that it was a wrong translation of a Greek word for Passover. On this point, Alexander Hislop commented: “Every one knows that the name ‘Easter’, used in our translation of Acts xii. 4, refers not to any Christian festival, but to the Jewish Passover. This is one of the few places in our version where the translators show an undue bias
        
         
        
        In the Bible Student’s Companion, William Nicholson wrote: “EASTER – An improper translation: for the feast of the passover is meant, Acts xii. 4. Easter was the name of a Pagan festival observed in spring by our ancestors, in honour of the goddess Astarte or Eostro, a saxon goddess, the Ashtaroth of Syria. In all other places pascha is rendered passover, the true meaning.”
        
         
        
        The word Easter in Acts 12: 4 in the Authorised Version, is rendered “Pasch” or “Passover” in other translations. The Douay Version (sometimes called Roman Catholic Bible by some) uses the word Pasch. The Revised Version, Moffatt Translation, Diaglott, New English Bible, Living Gospels and others render it Passover.
        
         
        
        About Easter the Westminster Dictionary of the Bible states: “Originally the spring festival in honor of the Teutonic goddess of light and spring known in Anglo-Saxon as Eastre. As early as the 8th century the name was transferred by the Anglo-Saxon to the Christian festival designed to celebrate the resurrection of Christ. In Authorised Version it occurs once (Acts 12: 4), but is a mistranslation. The original is pascha, the ordinary Greek word for Passover. Revised Version properly employs the word passover.”(Page 145).
        
         
        
        Pagan Origin
        
        Coming back to the origin of Easter, historians are unanimous on the point that it was all a pagan affair. It was nominal Christianity that gave it a gloss of respectability by associating it with the resurrection of Jesus Christ without any authority or commandment either of Christ himself or any Apostle. About Easter, E. Royston Pike, in his Encyclopedia of Religion and Religions, wrote: “According to the Venerable Bede, the name is derived from Eostre, the Anglo-Saxon goddess of spring whose festival was kept at the Spring equinox…” He went on: “There is no mention of the celebration of Easter in the New Testament and the Apostolic Age…From the first there was confusion over the date. In 325 the Council of Nicaea decreed that henceforth all Christians should observe Easter on the same day, which must be a Sunday; but for long there were wide differences in practice.” The historian then added: “Many times the proposal of fixing Easter has been ventilated, and in 1928 the British Parliament passed an Act providing that it should fall, on the first Sunday after the second Saturday in April.” (Pages 132-133).
        
         
        
        However, we do not intend to stretch into the details of Scripture as to why an issue of a Christian practice (if indeed it is) should not be decided by the Parliament of a worldly government. But we must emphasise that Easter has no connection whatsoever with true Christianity.
        
         
        
        Further confirmation of the pagan origin of Easter can be obtained from the Encyclopedia Britannica, which says: “The English name Easter is of uncertain origin; Bede in the 8th century derived it from that of the Anglo-Saxon spring goddess Eostre . Around the Christian observance of Easter as the climax of the liturgical drama of Holy Week and Good Friday folk customs have collected, many of which have been handed down from the ancient ceremonial and symbolism of the pagan spring festival brought into relation with the resurrection theme.” (Vol. 7. pp. 864-866).
        
         
        
        And what has The American Peoples Encyclopedia to say? “Many of the popular observances of Easter are pagan in origin. Some may be traced to the feast of the goddess Eostra…” (Vol. 7, page 483).
        
         
        
        It is our candid opinion based on the Bible that no matter how glamorously Easter on the surface is vested with the garments of Christianity, its pagan image remains the same. In the early centuries, the Romish Church was notorious for its tendency of conciliating the pagans into nominal Christianity, which it stood for, by wallowing in the mire of idolatry. This tendency was one of the factors, the Reformation campaigns notwithstanding, that led Christendom astray.
        
         
        
        “Memorial Supper”
        
        What was instituted by Jesus Christ was the “Memorial Supper” and NOT Easter. In doing it, he gave the bread and wine – representing his body and blood – to his apostles. (Matthew 26: 26-29). Not all believers in Christ ought to take the bread and wine; it is only those who belong to the group of Christians St. Paul called “the church of the firstborn” (meaning Christ’s cabinet ministers) that should take the bread and wine emblem. To serve the bread only and leave out the wine is incomplete and wrong; to mix the bread with wine as some churches are doing is a deviation from the Lord’s instructions, and is a sin; and to serve the supper on all disciples indiscriminately – men, women and children – instead of the spiritually matured faithful like the apostles, is a greater sin. Women and children ought not to take of the bread and wine. Jesus Christ had many faithful women disciples and also children followers but not one woman or child he made to take of it in his time. Why? And how many people know that to take the bread and wine unworthily is a curse? Think of these seriously. The answers are in the Bible. We shall treat them in a subsequent issue of the Weekly Sermon.
        
         
        
        The celebration of Easter is not authorised by the Holy Scriptures. Even the Passover festival had no connection with the resurrection of Christ. And if any Christian wishes to do anything in honour of Christ Jesus our Lord and Redeemer, he must abstain from all appearances of idolatory otherwise he worships in vain.`,

        content:`WHOEVER does not know Jesus Christ has no real knowledge of God, and, according to the Scriptures, he cannot be saved! (John 17:3) Among the creation of God, he is placed in a class distinguished beyond all others both in the heavenly realm and on this terrestrial globe. But to bring him into a line of equality with the Almighty Father is a damnable error.

        From the utterances and behaviour of some people who profess to be the followers of Jesus Christ, we are convinced that they do not, in fact, know him. The name Jesus is constantly upon the lips of men. While some for good reasons call him with due reverence, others do so either because of the merest trifle or out of religious fanaticism.
        
        During dinners or other parties or social gatherings certain people who are made merry by wine often exclaim, “O Gracious Jesus!” If they are not served with drinks in time, they shout on the attendants: “Will you please bring the bottle of beer for Jesus’ sake?” When some have eaten their fill and belched, they mumble: “O Jesus my Lord!” And even there are those who, when they are struck by a remark in an ordinary conversation, would say: “Jesus me!” All these utterances do not give honour to Jesus Christ but rather they are acts of sheer irresponsibility.
        
        Jesus Christ is the Beloved Son of the Almighty God who was sent to this evil world to show the light of life to men and shed his blood for the redemption of sinful mankind. In John 3: 16-19, it is written: “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved. He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.”
        
        Son of God.
        
        Some people say that God has no son in that He is not married, and so they argue that Jesus Christ is not the son of God. This is a very poor argument. The spiritual significance of the word father is one from whom life is d\erived, and son means one who receives life. It is in this light that Jesus Christ is the Son of God because he received life from Him. He said: “For as the Father hath life in Himself; so hath He given to the Son to have life in himself.” (John 5; 26) God is also the Father of other angels in heaven as well as of human beings on earth because “He giveth to all life and breath.” – Acts 17:24-28.
        
        However, the Sonship of Jesus Christ belongs to an exclusive category and is matchless. St. Paul in his letter to the Hebrews expatiated on this issue thus: “Long ago God spoke on many different ways to our fathers…but now in these days He had spoken to us through His Son …God’s Son shines out with God’s glory… He is the one who died to cleanse us and clear our record of all sin, and then sat down in highest honor beside the great God of heaven. Thus he became far greater than the angels, as proved by the fact that his name ‘Son of God’, which was passed on to him from his Father, is far greater than the names and titles of the angels.” The apostle continued: “For God never said to any angel, you are my Son, and today have given you the honor that goes with that name.’ But that is what God said about Jesus. Another time He said, ‘I am His Father and He is my Son…'” – Hebrews 1: 1-9, Living Letters.
        
        The Word
        
        The Bible clearly shows that the first thing ever created by the Almighty God was Jesus Christ, and he became the creative agent of the Father through whom all other things perfect, both visible and invisible, were created.
        
        Jesus Christ is known as the Word translated from the Greek word LOGOS, which is significant of his role as the spokesman or one through whom the Father expresses His will to mankind. In John 1: 1-3, it is written: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and without him was not anything made that was made.” Jesus Christ was created; but God the Father has neither beginning nor end but is “from everlasting to everlasting”. (Psalm 90: 2) Thus the “beginning” referred to in the text is the beginning of God’s creation when the Word (Jesus) was created and he who also is God the Son was with God the Father. Indeed Jesus is a God and Isaiah in prophecy called him the “mighty God”. – Isaiah. 9: 6, 7.
        
        It was the Word, NOT God Almighty that was made flesh, born on earth, and known as Jesus Christ. But the world which God gave him power to create did not recognise him when he came. As it is written: “And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth. He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not. He came unto his own, and his own received him not. But as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name.”-John 1: 14, 10-12.
        Jesus Christ is also known as “the Faithful and True Witness.” The fact that he was the first creation of God is further confirmed by the testimony of John the apostle in Revelation. He stated: “These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God.” – Revelation 3: 14.
        
        These were long hidden truths which God through His apostles revealed in the Holy Bible. Said St. Paul: “And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, Who created all things by Jesus Christ.” –  Ephesians 3: 9.
        
        Moreover, St. Paul in his epistle to the Colossians described Jesus Christ as “the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature”. And he added: “For by him (Jesus) were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him: and he is before all things, and by him all things consist. And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence. For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell.” – Colossians 1: 15-17.
        
        Chief Angel
        
        In the pre-human days of Jesus Christ he was the chief of the angels of God in heaven who were sent by Him to communicate with the holy men and prophets of old, and deliver them from troubles on certain occasions. – Genesis 18: 1-33; Exodus. 3: 1-6; Acts 7: 30-34; Daniel 3: 24-28.
        
        Jesus Christ has many other names and titles. Jacob in a prophetic declaration, referred to him, as Shiloh meaning a peaceful one. (Genesis 49: 10) He is also known as Emmanuel, Michael, Sun of Righteousness, the Son of Man, the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, the Root of David and so on. (Isaiah. 7: 14; Matthew 1: 23; Daniel 12: 1; Revelation 12: 7; Malachi 4: 2; Matthew 12: 8, 40; Revelation 5: 5.) And John the Baptist identified him as “the Lamb of God”. – John 1: 29.
        
        As a result of the sentence of death passed upon man after he had sinned through disobedience, it became necessary that the blood of a perfect man should be shed according to God’s purpose (Deuteronomy 19: 21; Hebrews 9: 22) to redeem man from sin and restore him to perfection. It was impossible to get such a perfect blood from the offspring of Adam since they were all born in sin. (Psalm 51: 5; Romans 3: 23; 5: 12). It was to this end Jesus Christ through the infinite power of Jehovah, the Almighty Father, was transformed from the spirit plane to human in the womb of Mary the virgin and born into this woeful world.
        
        Concerning the incarnation of Jesus Christ, St. Paul wrote: “Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is the devil. For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham. Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people ” – Hebrews 2: 14-18.
        
        Long before the human existence of Christ many prophecies were uttered about him. It was prophesied that he would be born a Jew and a prophet to whom all people should give ear (Genesis 49: 10; Deuteronomy 18: 15); that he would be born in Bethlehem (Micah 5 :2); that a forerunner would prepare the way of the Lord (Isaiah. 40: 3); that he would ride into Jerusalem upon an ass (Zechariah 9: 9); that he would be hated, despised and rejected of (ungodly) men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief (Isaiah. 53: 1-3).
        
        Furthermore, it was foretold that Jesus Christ would be betrayed by a familiar friend (Psalm 41: 9); that the price of betrayal would be 30 pieces of silver (Zechariah. 11: 12, 13); that he would be given gall and vinegar to drink (Psalm 69: 21); that he would be oppressed and brought like a lamb before the slaughter (Isaiah. 53: 4-7); and it was prophesied that he would be resurrected and his flesh would not see corruption. – Psalm 16: 10; Acts 2: 24 – 27.
        
        Truly, in God’s appointed time Jesus Christ was born of the virgin Mary and even angels in heaven sang for joy: “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.” (Luke 2: 7- 14) All the prophecies concerning him fulfilled accordingly. When he was about the age of 30 years, he received baptism from John the Baptist at the River Jordan. On that historic occasion, the Holy Spirit descended in the form of a dove and rested on him, and the Almighty Father declared in heaven: “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.” – Matthew 3: 13-17; Luke 3: 21-23.
        
        During the ministry of Christ on earth, he did many good works and miracles: he opened the eyes of the blind, the lame walked, the ears of the deaf were unstopped, at the village of Nain he stopped a funeral procession, raised to life a dead son and turned a widowed mother‟s grief to boundless joy; and most spectacular of all was the raising to life of Lazarus who had been laid in the tomb four days before and when his corpse had begun to decompose. -Luke 7: 11-16,22; John 11: 38-45.
        
        E. E. Kellett described Jesus as “a person of amazing impressiveness, force, and charm; that even after death he yet speaketh, and that today there are millions who, reading his words and contemplating his acts, cannot explain him but as in a sense divine; they feel him working in their hearts, controlling their lives, and inspiring an undying love. As in Galilee, so in England, he ‘goes about doing good’.” (A Short History of Religions)
        
        Primary Purposes
        
        Some of the primary purposes of Christ’s coming to the earth are:
        (1) To preach the truth or good news of God’s Kingdom in order to enlighten His sheep and free them from Satan’s bondage and so that they may serve God Almighty in truth and be saved. – Luke 4: 18-21; John 10: 9, 10; 18: 37; Luke 19: 10.
        (2) To give his life as a ransom by shedding his blood for the remission of sins. – Matthew20: 28; 26: 28; 1 Timothy 2: 6; Revelation 1: 5
        
        In character Jesus Christ was exemplary, and excellent in all virtues. He was truthful, kind, gentle, humble and lowly in heart. He never compromised with evil, and all his words and doings were characterised by holiness. He was a man of unbending faith, resisting temptation and was the very embodiment of wisdom. In zeal for the work of God and righteousness he was beyond compare. He was merciful, patient, long-suffering, loving and benevolent. To all mankind he directed his soul-consoling call: “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest unto your souls…” (Matthew 11:28-30).
        
        We cannot claim to be Christians if we are not making serious efforts to follow the good example of our Master and Saviour Jesus Christ. He himself said: “It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his Lord…” – Matthew 10: 25.
        
        Today the churches of Christendom are celebrating the Resurrection of Christ and they call it, incongruously, of course, “Easter”. But is it not true that some after attending church services, would go home and drink heavily at parties? Do some not secretly indulge in idolatry? Do some not consult witch doctors and oracle men or go about wearing charms in the form of rings, necklaces and so forth in order to get promotion or be protected? Will some not engage themselves in immoral pleasures today – their Easter day – and defile ungodly girls and women? Can they say that they are true disciples of Jesus? Unless all such ones refrain from sin and mould their characters to reflect Christ-like qualities they are still far from Jesus our Lord. Indeed, they are lip-worshippers. (Luke 6: 46-49; Titus 1: 16).
        
        Only Mediator
        
        It pays to be faithful and obedient in the Lord’s service. Jesus Christ, because of his submission to the will of his Father, has been blessed above all creatures in heaven and on earth. About this St. Paul wrote: “Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name. That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth. And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. ” – Philippians 2: 9-11.
        
        There was never a time Jesus Christ claimed to be equal to his Father, the Almighty God. Rather he said: “My Father is greater than I.” – John 14: 28.
        
        Jesus Christ is the only Mediator between God and men. (1 Timothy 2: 5) The Bible says it is through him alone that salvation to eternal life in God’s Kingdom can be obtained. “Neither is there salvation in any other,” declared St. Peter, “for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.” (Acts 4: 12) And Jesus himself said: “I am the way, the truth, and the life; no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.” – John 14: 6.`, 
        title:"WHO IS JESUS CHRIST?"},
     {key:30, 
        content:`ONE of the qualities on which the fundamental rules of Christianity are based and without which no one can please God Almighty, is FAITH. By it miracles have been wrought and changes most desirable for their worth in righteousness have been effected in the lives of men. All acts of holiness for which the ancient patriarchs, prophets and some women had good reputation as recorded in the Scriptures for our learning, were influenced and dictated by faith.

        The assent of the mind to, or a firm belief in the truth of God’s word as contained in the Holy Bible, or trust in God, is known as FAITH. Thus through faith we can hope for and be certain of realities we do not see.
        
         
        
        St. Paul in his letter to the Hebrews stated: “Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. For by it the elders obtained a good report.” And he added: “Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.” – Hebrews 11: 1-3.
        
         
        
        Importance
        
        The importance of faith in the Lord’s service cannot be overstated. We do not see God yet we firmly believe in His existence in that there are thousand and one evidences from the things we see around us that make us know that there is God. “For the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made”, said St. Paul, “even His eternal power and Godhead; so that they (the faithless and the wicked) are without excuse.” – Romans 1: 20.
        
         
        
        Again, there are many good things including eternal life God promised His people as there are also evil things with which He has purposed to reward those who trouble the earth. Although we have not seen these things meant for the future, we are constant in our belief and hope that He will surely do them because we trust in Him and have seen proofs of what He did in time past and what He is doing in our time. Such belief or hope is faith, and St. Paul said: “For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.” – Romans 8: 24-25.
        
         
        
        Illogical Ignorance
        
        From all these we can appreciate why people who suffer from “mental doubts” such as agnostics and atheists have always found themselves in internal as well as open conflict with the things of the Spirit of God. There are certain academicians and students who out of illogical ignorance consider it scholarly or scientific to denounce everything that is sacred. Some of them having imbibed certain vain philosophies based on “the method of systematic doubt” of Rene Descartes (1596-1650) can hardly believe in the existence of anything else other than themselves. And so it is no surprise that those who are entrapped in this worldly school of thought never know God.
        
         
        
        St. Paul had a very clear picture of the godless sort of intellectuals who deride the gospel of Christ even though it is the power of salvation to the believers. He stated: “For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God. For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent. Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this world? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? For after that in the wisdom of God the world by (its) wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.” – 1 Corinthians 1: 18-21.
        
         
        
        We as Christians cannot please God unless we have faith. As it is written: “But without faith it is impossible to please Him: for he that cometh to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him.” (Hebrews 11: 6) And St. Paul also said: “For we walk by faith, not by sight.” – 2 Corinthians 5: 7.
        
         
        
        Grace
        
        It is through faith, by the grace of God, that Christians will be justified and saved. “Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law,” stated St. Paul, “but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ. and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.’ (Galatians 2: 16) Furthermore, he said: “For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works lest any man should boast.” – Ephesians 2: 8. 9.
        
         
        
        Some people interpret the texts just cited to mean that once anybody believes in Jesus Christ and confesses him he is already saved and that our salvation does not depend on what we do but simply a matter of grace. This is very wrong. Anyone who continues to sin even though he professes to believe in Christ cannot be saved. St. Paul clarified the point enough when he added: “But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid.” – Galatians 2: 17.
        
         
        
        A converted sinner who claims that he believes in Jesus Christ as his personal saviour but still indulges in sin or gets into the bad company of those who love sinful pleasures, DOES NOT stand any chance of obtaining the grace of salvation. The reason is that the very grace conveys the divine instruction that we should abstain from the life of sin and turn to the practice of righteousness. As it is written: “For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world; looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ; who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify, unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.” – Titus 2: 11-14.
        
         
        
        The statement of the apostle that “by grace are ye saved through faith” gives the understanding vividly that for the grace to be effectual on any individual worshipper of God faith must be present. And faith does not mean a mere oral declaration of belief in God or Christ. “Not every one that saith unto me. Lord. Lord, shall enter into the Kingdom of heaven,” said Jesus, “but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.” – Matthew 7: 21.
        
         
        
        Works
        
        The doing of the will of God stressed by Jesus Christ calls for good works which we  must do to demonstrate our faith. A person who claims to have faith in God but does no work to justify his claim is deceiving himself and cannot be saved. Concerning this issue. James the apostle wrote: “What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him? If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food, and one of you say unto them. Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit? Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead being alone” The apostle went on: “Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works. Thou believest that there is one God: thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble. But wilt thou know, 0 vain man, that faith without works is dead?” – James 2: 14-20.
        
         
        
        St. James also gave practical examples of people such as Abraham and the woman Rahab who were justified by works of faith. Concerning Abraham he stated: “Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar? seest thou how faith wrought with works, and by works was faith made perfect? And the Scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God. Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, AND NOT BY FAITH ONLY.” – James 2: 21-24.
        
         
        
        There are many other instances in the Bible of men and women who showed their faith by what they did. Sarah, Abraham’s wife, had faith in God. When the Lord through His angel told her that she would conceive and bear a son, she believed despite the fact that she was already old and past age. Because of her faith God gave her strength to conceive and deliver a male child, Isaac. – Genesis 17: 19; 21: 1-3; Hebrews 11: 11, 12.
        
         
        
        In Hebrews chapter 11, St Paul gave a catalogue of some of the ancient faithful, starting from Abel to Rahab, whose acts of faith were marvellous. In addition, he stated: “And what shall I more say? for time would fail me to tell of Gideon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets: who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens. Women received their dead railed to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance: that they might obtain a better resurrection….” – Hebrews 11: 32-40.
        
         
        
        Great Faith
        
        In the days of Jesus Christ on earth he healed many people – both men and women – who had faith in him. When he entered Capernaum, a centurion (that is, a Roman army officer over a 100 men) came to him to ask for help. He said: “Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.” Jesus told him that he would go to his house and cure his servant. But the officer replied: “Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed “
        
         
        
        Jesus was greatly impressed by the faith implicit in what the officer said, and he told those who followed him: “Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.” Turning to the centurion, he said: “Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee.” At that very moment his servant recovered. – Read Matthew 8:5-13.
        
         
        
        A certain woman who suffered from an “issue of blood” (slow bleeding) for 12 years was healed instanter when she touched the edge of the garment of Jesus with faith. And Christ said to her: “Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.” -Luke 8: 43-48.
        
         
        
        There are other instances of people cured by Christ’s saying: “According to your faith be it unto you.” What we should learn from all these is the same importance of faith. If the people had no faith they would not have been healed.
        
         
        
        It is by faith through the grace and power of God we can resist and overcome the temptations and troubles of the devil. Said St. Paul: “In every battle you will need faith as your shield to stop the fiery arrows aimed at you by Satan ” (Ephesians 6:16, Living Letters) And St. Peter spoke of the trial of our faith and showed that if our faith remained strong after the tests, it would bring us praise, glory and honour. (1 Peter. 1: 17) He admonished the Christians: “Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour: whom resist steadfast in the faith …” – 1 Peter 5:8, 9.
        
         
        
        Before our prayers can be answered by God, there must be an element of genuine faith. Jesus said: “And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.” (Matthew 21: 22; Mark 11: 24) James the apostle said that if any man lacked wisdom he should ask God for it. “But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering,” he added. – James. 1: 5-8.
        
         
        
        However, some may ask as to how one can get faith. St. Paul gave the answer when he said: “So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.” (Romans 10: 17) This is one of the reasons why much importance is attached by understanding Christians to the assemblies where God’s word is preached in truth. Said St. Paul: “‘For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, the just shall live by faith.” – Romans 1: 16-17.
        
         
        
        Full Reward
        
        We therefore exhort every true Christian to hold fast his faith, and never to do anything in violation of it. “Stand fast in the faith”, charged St. Paul. (1 Corinthians 16: 13; see also Colossians 2: 7) He further exhorted: “Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water (the truth of God’s word). Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for He (God) is faithful that promised).” – Hebrews 10:22-23.
        
         
        
        If we are to obtain a full reward for our faith in God then we must be steadfast in His service till the end. “For we are made partakers of Christ,” said St. Paul, “if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end.” (Hebrews 3: 14) For this reason he gave the following counsel: “Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompense of reward. For ye have need of patience, that after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.” (Hebrews 10: 35,36) He went on to show that to do otherwise by shrinking back from the faith is disastrous. Said he: “Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him. But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.” – Hebrews 10: 38, 39.
        
         
        
        What is more, St. Peter showed that the end of our faith in Christ Jesus-though we do not see him – is salvation. He stated: “Whom (Christ) having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory: receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.” – 1 Peter 1: 8, 9.`,

        content:`DESPITE the pains theologians, philosophers and anthropologists have taken in their researches concerning human nature, soul still remains a subject about which very many people have wrong notions and unfounded beliefs. The teaching that the soul is immortal has no basis in the Holy Bible!

        As to what the soul is, definitions have been offered by both men of secular and ecclesiastical learning. According to Plato, the Greek philosopher, “the soul is that uncreated, eternal, and immaterial spirit which, itself self-moved, is the source of all motion; it is the principle of energy and life which, in death, is released from its bodily prison-house to live as separate spirit until again reincarnate in a living body”. (The American Peoples Encyclopaedia, Vol. 17, page 609)
        
         Rene Descartes (1596-1650), who is said to be the founder of modern philosophy, regarded the body and soul ”as separate substances that interact by means of the pineal gland in the brain”. But Baruch Spinoza (1632-77) in his own view denied interaction by any means and “asserted that soul and body are one and the same”. Since then other secular thinkers have developed various concepts of the soul without arriving at one conclusive understanding that is acceptable to all.
        
        As should be expected, none of the worldly thinkers including Aristotle, Thomas Hobbes, Gottfried Wilhelm and so on, based his opinion on the word of God, and, therefore, true Christians do not rely on their views. We as Christians cannot accept anything, no matter how academicals it may appear to be, which is not consistent with the revealed truth of God as contained in the Holy Bible.
        
        It was St. Paul who warned: “Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ” – Colossians 2:8.
        
        Common Prayer
        
        Turning to those who claim to be Christians it is sad to observe that the doctrines some are teaching concerning the soul are far from the truth. Among the Churches of Christendom it is believed that the soul is an immaterial thing in man that continues to live after a man’s death, and that it can never die. In view of this understanding, these churches believe that when any of their baptised members dies his soul goes to heaven to be with God for the enjoyment of divine blessings.
        
        In the Book of Common Prayer used in many Protestant Churches, “the Order for the Burial of the Dead” contains prayers in which their belief about the soul being taken to heaven after death is clearly expressed. At the burial of the dead, “while the earth shall be cast upon the body by some standing,” the officiating priest would say: “Forasmuch as it hath pleased Almighty God, of his great mercy to take unto himself the soul of our dear brother here departed: We therefore commit his body to the ground; earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust…” Another prayer often said by the priest is this: “Almighty God, with whom do live the spirits of them that depart hence in the Lord, and with whom the souls of the faithful, after they are delivered from the burden of the flesh, are in joy and felicity…”
        
        If it is true that the “souls of the faithful are in joy and felicity in heaven”, church-goers should have been rejoicing when their fellow- members die rather than crying and mourning as they are doing. And in that case, of course, everyone would want to die so as to go to a happier life above. But it is ludicrous that the very people who hold to this belief religiously are among those who fear more than anyone else to die; and when they fall sick they strive tooth and nail – and are prepared to spend all they have – to get themselves cured.
        
        These are some of the things that give cause for sceptics to jeer at religious beliefs, they themselves being unable to distinguish between genuine and nominal worshippers of God.
        
        Let us take a look at the following questions and answers from The Explanatory Catechism of the Roman Catholic Church:
        
         Question 5: “How is your soul like to God?”
        
        Answer:     “My soul is like to God because it is a spirit, and is immortal”
        
        Question 6: “What do you mean when you say that your soul is immortal?”
        
        Answer:      “When I say that my soul is immortal, I mean that my soul can never die.”
        
         
        
        The catechism defines spirit as “an immaterial living being, having free will and understanding, as God, the Angels, our souls”.
        
         
        
        It is a matter for regret that what the world has been pleased to refer to as “the Christian view” about soul, which millions have been taught to believe, cannot be substantiated with the Scriptures!
        
        Living Soul
        
        Soul, according to the Holy Bible, means a living creature such as a person or animal; it also means life, and in either of the two senses it is not immortal.
        
        The word soul first appeared in the Bible in Genesis 2: 7, where it is written: “And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life: and man became a living soul.” It is abundantly clear from this text that the man himself, which is made up of the dust of the ground and the breath of life, that is the “living soul”.
        
        This lucid account of the creation of man by God gives no idea that a soul was infused into the man. Rather it is the man that is a soul. That is why it is stated that those who went with Jacob to Egypt “were seventy souls”, meaning 70 persons. (Genesis 46:26, 27; Exodus 1: 5) And in Numbers 31: 28, both persons and beasts are referred to as souls.
        
        If the soul is a “living being” in man that continues to exist in heaven or elsewhere after death, then the man is not completely dead. This is precisely what the devil implied when he, in the guise of a serpent, deceptively told Eve: “Ye shall not surely die”. (Genesis 3: 2-5) It is this devilish idea that is being subtly fostered by the teaching of the immortality of the soul.
        
        What God told Adam was quite clear. He said, “For in the day that thou eatest thereof (that is, of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil) thou shalt surely die.” (Genesis 2: 16, 17) There was no point of another entity in man going to live elsewhere after death.
        
        We agree that there is a spirit in man (Job 32: 8) but it is NOT a “living being, having free-will and understanding” as stated in the catechism. The spirit is the life or power of existence in the breath of man which causes the organs of the human body to function. The same thing applies to animals. Yes, both man and beast have the same breath and die alike; God said so through Solomon His prophet: “For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no pre-eminence above a beast: for all is vanity. All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.” – Ecclesiastes 3: 19, 20.
        
        It is when the spirit or breath of life leaves a person that he dies, and when God gives him back the spirit at the resurrection, he lives again. As it is written: “Thou (God) hidest Thy face, they (the children of men) are troubled: Thou takest away their breath; they die, and return to their dust. Thou sendest forth Thy spirit, they are created: and Thou renewest the face of the earth.” – Psalm 104: 29, 30; see also Job 34: 14, 15; Ecclesiastes 12: 7, 8.
        
        The ordinary breath or breeze does not make a man to live. For instance, if you pump air into a dead body, it cannot be resuscitated because that air is without life. What distinguishes the breath of life from the ordinary breath is the life. And it is the life that is sometimes referred to as soul in the Bible. We can better appreciate this from the exhortation of Jesus Christ to his disciples that they should not fear the devil and his agents who cannot destroy life. He said: “And fear not them which kill the body but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.” – Matthew 10: 28.
        
        Jesus Christ made it quite clear here that the soul can die hence it can be killed in hell.
        
        Rest in Peace?
        
        Some people often publish advertisements in newspapers in memory of their dead parents, husbands, wives, children, relatives or friends. In such publications they are fond of writing thus: May your soul rest in peace, or, Eternal rest grant him O Lord. They have formed the habit of saying the same thing whenever they get to the graves of dead persons.
        
        Anyone who has a good understanding of the Scriptures knows that such prayers for the dead are unnecessary. The Bible says that everyone who dies, whether he is good or bad, goes to a state of rest or sleep – and so to remain until the day of resurrection. (Read Job 3: 11-19; 17: 13-16.) To wish the dead man “eternal rest” in that wise is tantamount to begging that he should not be resurrected by God. You see the spiritual implication? Yes, people do many things because of ignorance arising from the misguidance of false teachers. – Isaiah 9: 16; Hosea 4: 6; Matthew 15:14.
        
        Moreover, no amount of prayer said on behalf of a dead man has any effect on him. God will deal with the dead ONLY when they are raised to life. And even then He will judge and reward everyone according to the works he did when he was alive. If any had done evil, God’s verdict of guilt upon him can never be altered by the intercessions of men. This is why people should fear God and do what is right NOW that they are living so that they may be at peace with their Creator in the day of reckoning. – Ecclesiastes 12: 13, 14; 2 Corinthians 5:10; Hebrews 9:27.
        
        Some churches teach that the souls of the faithful at death are taken to heaven for their reward while those of the wicked go to hell for punishment. There is no place in the Holy Scriptures where it is so stated. What the Bible says is that the dead shall be resurrected in God’s Kingdom and everyone good or bad shall be rewarded according to his works. Jesus Christ said: “Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which ALL that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation (judgment).” – John 5: 28, 29.
        
        Mortal Soul
        
        It is indeed very wrong to say that the soul can never die. David the psalmist and prophet, said that none of the dead “can keep alive his own soul”. (Psalm 22: 29) And in Psalm 89:48, it is written: “What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? Shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave?”
        
        What is more, God himself declared: “Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.” (Ezekiel 18: 4, 20) Some may argue that it is only the soul that sins that will die. But we will ask who among men is not a sinner? That apart, if the soul is truly immortal then it can never die whether it sins or not.
        
        However, the truth is that the soul is subject to death. St. Peter stated that “every soul, which will not hear that prophet (Jesus Christ), shall be destroyed from among the people”. (Acts 3: 23) Those who love the world and refuse to pay heed to the gospel of Christ shall lose their lives in that they shall not be saved. And Jesus said: “For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own Soul?” (that is, his life). – Mark 8: 36.
        
        But those who are faithful and obedient to their Creator and who worship Him in truth shall spend their days in prosperity and their years in pleasures and, above all, everlasting life shall be their reward in God’s Kingdom.
        
        It is clear from the Bible truth expounded in this sermon that the soul of man is MORTAL – IT DIES. Here again we have told you, dear reader, the truth which Jesus Christ says will make his sheep free.`, 
        title:"IS THE SOUL IMMORTAL?"},
     {key:32, 
        content:`WHATEVER the achievements of any man – in scholarship, position or material wealth- he can never command the respect of decent people in society if he has no integrity. According to the Scriptures, integrity is a safe guide to those who have it. A man of integrity is a man of noble character and of an excellent spirit.

 

        The word integrity is defined as meaning uprightness of character – that is, the state of being honest, just, honourable and sincere. Figuratively, it is the controlled realisation of all the component aspects of one’s personality.
        
         
        
        From the definition given, we can at once understand that it is lack of Integrity that makes men and women commit acts of immorality, dishonesty and such like even though they know that it is evil to do them.
        
         
        
        Practical Example
        
        Esau, one of the twin sons of Isaac, is a practical example of a man who has no integrity. He gave himself to carnal things, and for a mess of pottage when he suffered from hunger he sold his birthright to Jacob, his younger brother! (Genesis 25: 29-34) If he were a godly man who had integrity, he would rather have preferred to die of hunger than, for a single meal, to part with his birthright.
        
         
        
        Christians are warned against the ungodly conduct of Esau. In his epistle to the Hebrews, St. Paul stated: “Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord: looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God…lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright. For ye know how that afterward, when he wou1d have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance though he sought it carefully with tears.” – Hebrews 12: 14-17.
        
         
        
        Today, there are people who behave like Esau. Because they lack integrity they often conduct themselves improperly at social gatherings or on other occasions whenever meals or drinks are served. They look at the dishes or bottles of beer with greedy eyes” and as soon as the table is declared open they eat and drink without any sense of moderation or dignity, and manifest all the traits of a glutton.
        
         
        
        But people who have respect for themselves always like to maintain their integrity. They are temperate in all things: in speech they are moderate and in behaviour they show self-control. For all these they are held in high esteem. It is clearly shown in the Scriptures that temperance or moderation is a Christian virtue. St. Paul stated that the fruit of the Spirit is temperance (Galatians 5: 22, 23); and he admonished: “Let your moderation be known unto all men”. – Philippians 4: 5.
        
         
        
        In a certain town in one of the African States, there was a man who for lack of integrity was made an object of ridicule. He was depraved in character – he sexed lawlessly with young and even old women and seduced ungodly married women from their husbands. He was often penalised and made to pay damages because of his evil deeds. In the long run he died young. However, there was an aspect of his life which needs be pointed out to teach others some lesson. When it became known that the man had no integrity being an immoral character he was always suspected of sinister motives or indecorous manners whenever he was found talking to any woman even if his intentions were good. This man, until his death, was never a happy soul.
        
         
        
        “Useless Bosses”
        
        Integrity is a very good thing, and every Christian is required to be honest and upright in the service of God. King David, in his song, prayed to God: “O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I put my trust in Thee. Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on Thee.” (Psalm 25: 20, 21) There was need for him to pray for integrity because he knew what he suffered for seducing his neighbour’s wife. (2 Samuel chapters 11 and 12).
        
         
        
        There are some people who are highly placed in this world but because they have no integrity they are not given their due respect. An executive officer who is often found flirting with his female secretary or typist or known to be making immoral advances to loose women is selling away his honour. Responsible, decent women who work with executive or senior officers of such a character see them as “useless bosses”. This same opinion was expressed by a lady secretary as published in the SPEAR magazine issue of April, 1969. About “making love in the office”, she said: “This is very true. A few girls who are not efficient in their work try to appease their bosses by offering their bodies so that they can still be kept in the office. And once these useless bosses get enjoyment and satisfaction there will be no complaint.”
        
        There are complaints that certain heads of departments are fond of demanding bribes or “tips” from the workers under them. By their indulgence in bribery such high officers are not only committing sin but are also making themselves very mean.
        
        The Psalmist said in his prayer: “Judge me, O LORD; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in the LORD; therefore I shall not slide…Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men. In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes. But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity, redeem me, and be merciful unto me.” – Psalm 26: 1,9-11.
        
         
        
        Uprightness
        
        Despite the shortcomings of David for which he fully repented, God was pleased with him because of the integrity of his heart. To Solomon, the son of David, God said: “And if thou wilt work before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and my judgments, then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever, as I promised to David thy father, saying, there shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel.” – 1 Kings 9: 4, 5.
        
        Job was also a man of integrity. Although the devil subjected him to severe temptations he did not deny God neither did he turn away from righteousness; rather “still he holdeth fast his integrity”. (Job 2: 3) When his faithless wife became despondent because of the severity of the test, she said to her husband: “Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die.” But Job’s answer reflected faith, manliness and real integrity. He told her bluntly: “Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lipss.” – Job 2: 9, 10.
        
        What is more, Job himself declared: “All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils; my lips shalt not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit. Till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me. My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go.” – Job. 27: 3-6.
        
        Is it not true that certain so-called Christians become lukewarm in their religious devotions when they fall into temptations of the devil? Do some not resort to idolatry when they or their children are sick? And when for some time they get no employment, do they not consult oracle men or occultists contrary to God’s laws? (Deuteronomy 18. 10-12, Isaiah. 8:19).
        
        A certain man, because his beautiful wife died, said that there was no God. It was his opinion that God ought not to have allowed his wife to die if He existed. His temptation was not in any way comparable to that of Job but since he had no faith or integrity he fell fiat. Whereas in the case of Job, his faith, integrity and patience brought him abundance of reward. “So the Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning” (Job. 42: 12-17) And St. James wrote: Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.” – James. 5: 10. 11.
        
        We as Christians should always maintain our integrity by doing things in the fear of God and with faith. We must not allow the devil through ungodly friends or relatives to turn us from the path of rectitude or the faith of Christ. Said God through Solomon: “My son, if sinners, entice thee, consent thou not. If they say, come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause. Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole as those that go down into the pit. We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil. Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse. My son walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path. For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.” – Proverbs. 1: 10-16.
        
        No one can lead a true Christian life without integrity. The Bible says: “The integrity of the upright shall guide them: but the perverseness of transgressor shall destroy them,” (Proverbs 11: 3) Again it is written: “The just man walketh in his integrity; his children are blessed after him” – Proverbs 20:7.
        
        A woman of integrity will never because of the love of carnal things like money, gold, silver, clothes, cars, ultra- modern flats and so on, run away from her husband to “marry” another man. It is a foolish and ungodly woman that does so, and God will certainly punish her except she repents enough. What is important in a woman is not wealth, worldly fashion, beauty or her education but the fear of God and integrity which must be reflected in good manners. King Solomon stated: “A gracious woman retaineth honour…” (Proverbs 11; 16) And he further said: “A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband; but she that maketh ashamed is as rottenness in his bones.” – Proverbs 12: 4.
        
         
        
        Clean Hands
        
        A man or woman who is poor but has integrity is better than a rich man or woman who is of a shady or dubious character. A man may ride in cars or live in a beautiful house and yet will not inspire respect if he has no integrity. Said King Solomon: “Better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness, than he that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich.” – Proverbs 28:6.”
        
        To have clean hands and keep a clear conscience is very good indeed. It inspires self-confidence. If you have no guilty conscience, you sleep well and good in the night and will not be haunted by the fear of law officers. Whenever you come across a policeman you will have no cause to fidget or quail in heart. Yes, the Bible says: “He that walketh uprightly walketh surely: but he that perverteth his ways shall be known.” – Proverbs 10: 9.
        
         
        
        Some highly placed persons are sometime asked to relinquish their offices because of what is often termed an abuse of trust. They usually start well, but later succumb to evil influences owing to their lust for filthy lucre which makes them throw their integrity to the wind, and end up in disgrace. It was Solomon who said: “Dead flies make the perfumer’s ointment give off an evil odour; so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honour.” – Ecclesiastes10: 1. Revised Standard Version.
        
        In order that we may be saved, we are required to live up to expectation in the Lord. Anyone who calls himself a Christian but goes about stealing, taking bribes, telling lies, committing fornication or perpetrating any other form of wicked act, is deceiving himself; he will be justly punished and cannot obtain God’s salvation. – Proverbs 11:19,21; 2 Corinthians 5: 10; Revelation 21: 8.
        
         
        
        As regards the qualities of those who deserve to remain in God’s Organisation to enjoy His goodness, the Psalmist stated: “LORD, who shall abide in Thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in Thy holy hill? He that walketh uprightly and speaketh the truth in his heart. He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour. In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth them that fear the LORD. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not. He that putteth not out his money to usury. nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved.” – Psalm 15: 1-5.
        
         
        
        And what is more, St. Paul said: “Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report, if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things. Those things, which ye have both learned and received, and heard, and seen in me, do; and the God of peace shall be with you.” – Philippians 4: 8, 9.
        
        Yes, “The integrity of the upright shall guide them: but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them.” – Proverbs 11: 3.`,

        content:`ONE of the doctrines that the clergymen of Christendom have given false colouring without restraint is that about HELL. Does the Holy Bible give a picture of hell as a place of literal fire where the wicked are tortured everlastingly? If it is so, why did Jesus Christ the righteous go to hell?

        In the Explanatory Catechism of Christian Doctrine, it is stated that hell is “the place where the devils and lost souls are punished”. And the Catholic Encyclopedic Dictionary, (Second Edition, Revised) states as follows: “HELL is the place and state of eternal punishment which consists, primarily, in the deprivation of the enjoyment and sight of God face to face (pain of loss) and, secondarily, the infliction of positive punishment by an external objective agent, called fire, which is a physical reality though unlike earthly fire (pain of sense). This punishment is not equal for all, but corresponds to the sinner’s aversion from God and conversion to creatures…. It is of faith that their punishment will never end.” (Page 226).
        
        Exaggeration
        
        On the basis of this knowledge, several pictures of hell as a place of horrors have been painted in order to frighten the believers into subjection to the priests. Also, stories of unlimited exaggeration about hell have been invented and told from the pulpits, to the extent that the sermons have had more bearings on intimidation than exhortation.
        
        The Rev. J. Furness, in his description of the lowest depth of hell, stated that “the roof is red-hot, the walls are red: the floor is like a thick sheet of red hot iron”. He further wrote as follows:
        “Listen to the tremendous, the horrible uproar of millions and millions of tormented creatures, mad with the fury of hell. Oh, the screams of fear, the groanings of horror, the yells of rage, the cries of pain, the shouts of agony, the shrieks of despair, from millions on millions. There you hear them roaring like lions, hissing like serpents, howling like dogs, and wailing like dragons. There you hear the gnashing of teeth, and the fearful blasphemies of the devils. Above all you hear the roarings of the thunders of God’s anger, which shake hell to its foundations. But there is another sound. There is in hell a sound like that of many waters; it is as if all the rivers and oceans in the world were pouring themselves with a great splash don on the floor of hell. Is it then, ready the sound of waters? It is. Are the rivers and oceans of the earth pouring themselves into hell? No. What is it then? It is the sound of oceans of tears running down countless millions of eyes. They cry forever and ever. They cry because the sulphurous smoke torments their eyes. They cry because they are in darkness. They cry because they have lost the beautiful heaven. They cry because the sharp fire burns them.” (The World’s Redemption, page 343).
        
        It is sad to note that certain people who parade themselves as the ambassadors of Jesus Christ and teachers of his word should be so shameless and lost to virtue in telling blatant lies even in the name of God! Has anybody ever gone to “hell” and come back to tell those dreadful stories? How do the clergy come about such ideas of hell? Was it by revelation from the Scripture or by dream?
        
        We must admit that by the teaching of the clergy concerning hell, they portray God as a heartless and cruel Father. No one can imagine how the Almighty God who is infinitely kind and loving and whose “mercy endureth forever” can keep human creatures to be tormented – in sharp fire where the victims are “roaring like lions, hissing like serpents, howling like dogs and wailing like dragons”-for eternity. The Holy Bible does not lend support to this bogus teaching.
        
        The word hell is derived from the Hebrew word sheol and the Greek word hades, and it means the grave, pit, tomb or the condition of the dead. Another Greek word also translated hell in the New Testament of the Bible is Gehenna. It is a word with a historical background used figuratively in the Greek Scriptures.
        
        There is not a word in the account of the creation to show that God prepared a place with fire for the eternal punishment of sinners. In the first chapter of Genesis there is a comprehensive record of how the heaven and the earth, the sun, moon and stars and the seas were created. If there were such an important place of unquenchable fire where there are “millions and millions of tormented creatures”, as taught by certain churches, it would not have been omitted from the inspired account of the creation.
        
        When God placed Adam in the Garden of Eden, He told him definitely that if he (Adam) ate of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, death would be the penalty. (Genesis 2: 16, 17) So when Adam disobeyed the divine commandment the sentence of death was passed on him, and God said: “In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust (NOT FIRE) shalt thou return.” – Genesis 3: 19
        
        If there were such a place of fire for the punishment of sinners, Adam through whose disobedience sin entered the world would have gone there. In fact, God would have given an indication to that effect at the time He pronounced His sentence on Adam. What He told Adam was that he (Adam) would die and return to the dust. And St. Paul stated: “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” – Romans 6: 23.
        
        Grave
        
        Hell is the grave, pit or heart of the earth where every kind of character – good or bad- goes after death. It is not meant for the wicked alone. Jacob was a godly man and it was through his twelve sons the nation of Israel came into being. When he received the news that Joseph his son, was dead (false it was though) he refused to be comforted and he said: “I will go down to my son into hell, mourning.” (Genesis 37: 35, Douay Version) But the Authorised or King James Version renders the text thus: “For I will go down unto the grave unto my son mourning,”
        
        It is the same Hebrew word sheol that is translated hell in the Douay Version (Catholic Bible, as some call it) and grave in the Authorised Version.
        
        Did Jacob mean that his son Joseph was gone into hell as referring to a place of fire and that he too would go there? Why should they go to such a place if really it existed? Were they wicked? Of course, they were not. The truth is that Jacob knew that the grave or hell is the place of the dead, and so he did not refer to a place of fire.
        
        When on another occasion Jacob was being persuaded by Reuben and others of his children to allow them to take Benjamin to Egypt, he told them: “My son shall not go down with you. His brother (Joseph) is dead, and he is left alone: if any mischief befall him in the land to which you go, you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrows to hell.” (Genesis 42: 38, Douay Version.) Hell here is the grave.
        
        Job the prophet of God showed clearly that hell or grave is a place of rest and hiding for both good and wicked people who die. During his troubles which the devil brought upon him he cursed the day of his birth and said that it were better if he had died in the womb because then he would have lain still and quiet in the grave with kings, counsellors and princes. He added: “There (in the grave or hell) the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest. There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor. The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master.” – Read Job. 3: 11-19.
        
        Furthermore, Job, in the bitterness of his soul, prayed to God: “O that Thou wouldest hide me in the grave (“protect me in hell”- Douay Version), that Thou wouldest keep me secret, until Thy wrath be past, that Thou wouldest appoint me a set time and remember me.” (Job. 14: 13) If hell is a place of torment, why should Job who needed escape or relief from his anguish pray to be hidden there till God’s wrath was over?
        
        There is also the instance of Jonah, the prophet of God, who called the belly of a fish, hell. When he was making a desperate attempt to run away from carrying out the Lord’s message, he was thrown from a ship into the sea and was swallowed by a whale. “Then Jonah prayed unto the Lord his God out of the fish’s belly, and said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the Lord, and He heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and Thou heardest my voice.” (Jonah 2: 1, 2) But was there fire in the fish’s belly? No! Jonah called the fish’s belly, hell because it was like a grave – in fact, there he would have breathed his last and remained buried if God had not been merciful to him.
        
        There is no doubt that the wicked will be punished by God. The Bible states that when God will pour out His indignation upon them they would make every effort to escape and would even want to dig into hell for safety but all their efforts will prove abortive. As it is written: “I saw the Lord standing upon the altar: and He said… cut them in the head, all of them; and 1 will slay the last of them with the sword: he that fleeth of them shall not flee away, and he that escape of them shall not be delivered. Though they dig into hell, thence shall mine hand take them; though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down…” – Amos 9: 1-4.
        
        The point is that if hell is a place of horrible fire, why should anyone seeking refuge from trouble dig into it? That, of course, will amount to jumping from the frying pan into fire.
        The Bible shows that all men are subject to death and that no one has the power to save himself from going into the grave. The Psalmist asked: “Who is the man that shall live, and not see death: that shall deliver his soul from the hand of hell?” (Psalm 88: 49, Douay Version) But in the Authorised Version the text is at Psalm 89: 48, and it reads: “What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave?” From this again we see that hell is the grave and there is no fire in it.
        
        There is one other striking instance to show that hell means the pit or heart of the ground. In the days of Moses the prophet, there was an occasion when he received stiff opposition from some of the Jews prominent among whom were Korah, Dathan, On and Abiram. They conspired and organised a rebellion against Moses and Aaron. God was not in their favour and they were justly punished. Moses warned the congregation to dissociate themselves from those wicked men. He said that if they died the common death of all men, then the Lord had not sent him but if the ground broke open, and swallowed them then it should be known that they had provoked God.
        
        “And it came to pass, as he (Moses) had made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that was under them and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up… They and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the pit (inside the ground) and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the congregation.” – Numbers 16: 1-4,25-33.
        
        The Douay Version renders the piece as follows: “And immediately as he (Moses) had made an end of speaking, the earth broke asunder under their feet; and opening her mouth, devoured them with their tents and all their substance. And they went down alive into hell, the ground closing upon them.” This again confirms beyond’ doubt that it is a pit or inside the ground that is known as HELL.
        
        Gehenna
        
        We stated earlier that the Greek word Gehenna also translated hell in the New Testament is a picture word with a historic origin. It has an entirely different meaning from hades.
        
        Gehenna is compounded of two Hebrew words, Ge Hinnom-that is, “the valley of Hinnom” or “the valley of the son of Hinnom”. It was a place on the outskirts of Jerusalem in which children we cruelly sacrificed by fire to Molech, the idol of the Ammonites. – 2 Kings 23: 10; 2 Chronicles 28: 1-3; 33: 1, 2, 6.
        
        God condemned the Jews who committed the abomination of burning their children in fire. Said He: “And they built high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart.” – Jeremiah 7: 30, 31.
        
        The valley of Hinnom became a place for depositing refuse. All sorts of rubbish, dead animals and even corpses of criminals were dumped there. Worms were always around to consume the rotten things and there was fire underneath that kept burning, consuming the rubbish. This place was identified with the destruction of undesirables. It was against the background of this notion that Jesus in Mark 9: 43-48, used the word Gehenna translated hell or hell fire to symbolise the everlasting destruction of the wicked.
        
        Among other things, he said: “And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the Kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes, to be cast into hell fire: where the worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.” (Mark 9: 47-48) It is very wrong to interpret this text literally because it will mean that we should pull out our eyes if they irritate or itch us and so on. Christ used the eye to symbolise anything that is precious to us. So he used the hand, foot, and eye separately to illustrate the value of sacrifices we, his followers, should make in order to prove ourselves worthy of the Kingdom of God.
        
        In other words, Christ was saying in effect that if anything very dear to us would cause us to go to everlasting destruction, it will be better to deny ourselves and forsake that thing – even if it is as precious as an eye – so that we may enter God’s Kingdom.
        
        The fire therefore is not a literal object but a symbol of the suffering or severe pain -“weeping and gnashing of teeth” – which God would make the wicked taste while alive before they go to perpetual destruction which is also known as the “second death” – that is, the death in which there is no more favour or chance of resurrection. After they have died, they do not suffer pain any more (Isaiah. 66: 15, 16; Romans 2:5,6,8-9; 2 Thessalonians 1:7-9; 2 Peter 3:7, 10; Revelation 21: 8).
        
        Concerning the punishment of the wicked in the last days, St. Paul stated: “And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.” – 2 Thessalonians 1: 7-9.
        
        We must point out that the punishment of the wicked takes place when they are living – either in this life or at the resurrection of the dead. The Bible makes it abundantly clear that the dead are unconscious and therefore they cannot feel pain. “For the living know that they shall die,” said King Solomon, “but the dead know not anything ” – Ecclesiastes 9: 5, 6.
        
        “Apostles’ Creed”
        
        On the whole, let no one be deceived that there is a place of literal fire -“red-hot” as Rev. Furness without Scriptural proof said – where the wicked are being tortured forever. In the so-called Apostles’ Creed of the churches it is stated that Jesus Christ suffered under Pontius Pilate, “was crucified, dead, and buried: he descended into hell“. If hell is for the wicked only, Christ would not have “descended” into it. He was not wicked.
        
        Of a truth Jesus Christ went to hell in fulfilment of prophecy and God raised him the third day from the grave. He himself said: “For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale’s belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.” – Matthew 12: 40.
        
        Concerning Christ’s resurrection, David the Psalmist, stated: “For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell (sheol – grave) neither wilt thou suffer thy Holy One to see corruption.”- (Psalm 16: 10) And St. Peter, dilating on the prophecy after it had fulfilled, said: “Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day. Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne; he seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell (grave) neither his flesh did see corruption. This Jesus hath God raised up whereof we all are witnesses.” – Acts 2: 29-32.
        
        Hell, we reiterate, is the grave, and it is from there both good and bad will come back during the resurrection. As it is written: “Wonder not at this; for the hour cometh wherein all that are in the graves (not fire or heaven) shall hear the voice of the Son of God. And they that have done good things shall come forth (from hell or grave, not heaven) unto the resurrection of life; but they that have done evil; unto the resurrection of judgment.” – John 5: 28, 29, Douay Version.
        
        What some people call limbo or purgatory exists only in the imagination of some teachers, and not in reality or in the pages of the Holy Bible. We shall go into details on this issue at another time. It is the truth Jesus said will make us free.

        content:`THE Church of God, wherever it is established in any part of the world, is never divided but one in faith, fellowship, love and in preaching God’s word – the truth. Jesus Christ was fully aware that Christianity, which he founded by the power of God, would in process of time be counterfeited by some people at the instance of Satan, the arch-enemy of God and man. And so, he did not leave his disciples without setting out the marks by which his true Church could be identified.

        THE teaching that baptism is intended to wash away sins has given rise to the question as to why Jesus Christ who did no sin was baptized. Anyone who accepts to follow Christ is required as of faith to be baptized. But any baptism that does not conform to the standard of the example set by him and his early apostles or that is not based on the knowledge of the truth as contained in the Holy Bible, is invalid and, therefore, not recognised by God.
        
         
        
        Baptism is one of the issues on which the churches are divided. There are those who administer baptism by immersion but some others apply pouring or sprinkling of water. While some baptise infants, others do not. In fact, there are several formalities or ceremonies now associated with baptism in certain religious circles which are questionable.
        
         
        
        In view of the diversity of beliefs and practices among the church groups, when some people who have received baptism in one denomination are converted to another church group they are re-baptised. The reason is that the latter group considers the baptism by the former to be invalid.
        
        A question was asked as to why Catholics re-baptised a person who had been baptised in his own church but had left it to become a Catholic. The answer was given by the Roman Catholic Church as follows: “Three things are necessary for valid baptism, namely, (1) correct intention, i.e. to do what Christ commanded, (2) correct words, i.e. those given in the Scriptures, (3) correct action, i.e. pouring of water on the head of the person while pronouncing the correct formula. The baptism given in many non-Catholic Churches is of extremely doubtful validity because of lack of one or more of these things. For this reason the Catholic Church gives conditional baptism to all persons coming from them.” (Vide The Catholic Voice, issue of November, 1956).
        
         
        
        The answer to question 256 in The Explanatory Catechism of Christian Doctrine, is this: “Baptism is a Sacrament which cleanses us from original sin, makes us Christians, children of God, and members of the Church.” And in answer to question 257 it is stated that “baptism also forgives actual sins, with all punishment due to them…”
        
         
        
        Remission
        
        We must say quite frankly that the teaching that baptism cleanses one from sin has not the backing of the Scriptures. We hold that if baptism were meant to wash away sin, Jesus Christ would not have been baptised because he was not a sinner. Concerning him, St. Peter wrote: “Who (Jesus) did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth.” – 1 Peter 2: 21, 22.
        
         
        
        The Bible shows clearly that it is the blood of Jesus Christ that cleanses one from sin. Christ himself gave his disciples to understand, when he instituted the “Memorial Supper”, that his blood was to be shed for the purpose of remitting the sins of many people. When he took the cup containing the wine made from the fruit of the vine, he gave thanks and gave it to the apostles, saying, “Drink ye all of it; for this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.” – Matthew 26: 27, 28.
        
         
        
        Indeed, St. Paul stated: “And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.” – Hebrews 9: 22.
        
         
        
        We must point out as well that the blood of Jesus Christ has no effect on anyone who does not believe in him or accept the truth of the gospel. In other words, it is when we have faith in Christ and are guided by the light of his word, according to the Scriptures, that we can receive forgiveness of our sins through his blood. As it is written: “But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin” – 1 John 1: 7; see also Revelation 1: 5.
        
         
        
        Let us consider some of the practices of certain churches in the ministration of baptism and compare them with the Bible so as to satisfy ourselves as to where the truth is.
        
        As regards how baptism is given The Explanatory Catechism, under question 259, answers thus: “Baptism is given by pouring water on the head of the child…” This method is not peculiar to the Roman Catholic Church; there are other denominations that also baptise their adherents by pouring or sprinkling water.
        
         
        
        The baptism of infants is one of the issues often discussed by theologians. In the Roman Catholic, the Anglican and some other Protestant Churches, any infant to be baptised must be represented by “godparents” as his sureties. According to the Book of Common Prayer “there shall be for every male child to be baptised two Godfathers and one Godmother; and for every female, one Godfather and two Godmothers”.
        
         
        
        At a stage during the ceremony the Priest proceeds to ask a series of questions which the godfathers and godmothers answer in the name of the child. For example, the Priest first of all asks: “Dost thou renounce the devil and all his works, the vain pomp and glory of the world….and the carnal desires of the flesh … ?” Answer. “I renounce them all.”
        
         
        
        Then the Priest further asks: “Dost thou believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth? And in Jesus Christ His only begotten Son our Lord? ” Answer. “All this I steadfastly believe.”
        
         
        
        Again, the Priest asks: “Wilt thou then obediently keep God’s holy will and commandments and walk in the same all the days of thy life?” Answer. “I will.”
        
         
        
        But we have seen from experience that when such a baptised infant became an adult, his character reflected the very converse of the answers given by the godparents. This is so because the child was not converted. He should have attained the age of reasoning and accepted Christ himself before he was baptised. It is very wrong to appoint godfathers and godmothers: there is no precedent in the Scriptures!
        
         
        
        Ceremonies
        
        In the Roman Catholic Church the ceremonies of baptism are more elaborate. The details were published in the Catholic Voice issue of February 1959. Therein it was stated that “without baptism one cannot enter heaven”. This belief accounts for the zeal with which innocent children are rushed by parents into an ordeal of ceremonies of which they know nothing.
        
         
        
        The Catholic Voice states: “THE CEREMONIES OF BAPTISM BEGIN AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE CHURCH. Why? The newly-born child is not yet a child of God. Unclean by original sin, its soul is displeasing to God. So its father and mother, little brothers and sisters and auntie-sponsor holding the baby, stand at the door of the church to beg for Baptism. The priest meets them at the door and says to the child…. what dost thou ask of the Church of God? And the godmother answers for her: Faith. The priest asks: what doth faith bring thee to? And the sponsor answers: Life everlasting. The priest says: If then thou desireth to enter into life, keep the commandments…”
        
         
        
        The Voice states that “several times during the ceremonies of baptism the priest orders the devil, by God’s power, to go out”. The priest gently breathes thrice upon the face of the child and says once: “Go out of him (her) thou unclean spirit, and give place unto the Holy Spirit the Paraclete (Comforter).” The priest blesses salt so that it may be “a perfect medicine” and then puts a little into the mouth of the child, saying: ” Receive the salt of wisdom…”
        
         
        
        The sign of the cross made on the forehead and breast of the child by the priest is said to be “the mark of God’s children”. After the ceremony of exorcising the devil the second time and saying some prayers, “the priest puts the end of his stole (a strip of silk worn round the neck with the ends hanging down in front) on the child, leading her into the Church, saying…Come into the temple of God, that thou mayest have part with Christ unto life everlasting.”
        
        This is followed by the opening of the ears of the child to God’s word. “The priest, wetting his thumb with spittle, touches therewith, in the form of a cross, the right and left ear of the child, saying: Ephpheta, that is to say, be opened. Then he touches the nostrils, saying: For a savour of sweetness. But thou, satan, be gone, behold the judgment of God.” All these, dear reader, are not ordered by God and cannot be found in the Bible!
        
         
        
        Furthermore, A Catholic Dictionary has this to say: “If there is not a probable hope that a child can be baptised after birth, Baptism may be administered in the womb… An aborted foetus must also be baptised, unconditionally or conditionally according to circumstances.” This is sheer nonsense! Modesty prevents us from commenting further on this practice.
        
         
        
        There is no one who has read the Holy Bible with a good understanding that cannot be weighed down with disgust at certain unscriptural and filthy ceremonies and practices that are done in the name of Christ. It is the introduction into the Church of invented dogmas and ceremonies which have neither the backing of the Scriptures nor the taste of reason, that has caused many people to go astray and even become agnostics.
        
         
        
        Immersion
        
        The truth of the Bible about baptism cannot be covered. The word baptism is derived from the Greek word baptizo or baptizmo, and it means immersion or dipping in water.
        
         
        
        From this definition, we can get a clear view of the fact outright that the system of pouring or sprinkling water is altogether wrong. There is not a single instance in the Bible where any follower of Jesus Christ was baptised by such a method. Jesus Christ himself was baptised in Jordan River at about the age of 30 – not at all as an infant! Water was not sprinkled on him. Saint Matthew’s record of the occasion reads: “And Jesus, when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him. And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased,” – Matthew 3: 16-17; see also Luke 3: 21-23.
        
         
        
        This example of Christ’s baptism is the standard all his true followers are bound to follow. It was devoid of unnecessary ceremonies. No one stood as a “godfather” or “godmother” and he licked no salt. His baptism did not take place in a Synagogue but at a river where he could be and was dipped in water. And we must follow the example of our Saviour, and if the meaning of baptism is not to be defeated, all who are to be baptised MUST BE IMMERSED.
        
         
        
        John the Baptist administered baptism to people where there was enough water. As it is written: “And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there and they came, and were baptized.” – John 3: 23.
        
         
        
        Another instance in the Bible is that of the eunuch of Ethiopia who was baptised by Philip, the apostle of Christ. The eunuch was a treasurer under the queen of the Ethiopians. There was an occasion when he went to Jerusalem to worship, and while he was returning he read from the book of Isaiah the prophet. Through the direction of the Spirit of God, Philip wont close to him and asked him: “Understandest thou what thou readest? And he answered quite honestly: “How can I, except some man should guide me?” He then invited Philip to sit with him in his chariot, and Philip preached to him about Jesus Christ.
        
         
        
        Here is the account of what followed: “And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized? And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. And he commanded the chariot to stand still; and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him. And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.” – Acts 8: 26-40.
        
         
        
        Symbol
        
        According to the Bible, it is required that a person to be baptised must be immersed and covered by the water as a symbol of burial of one’s sinful desires and also into death. This signifies that he has agreed to do the will of God all the days of his life until, if it pleases God, death. And being raised out of the water is a symbol of resurrection, which is the hope of Christians, and it denotes regeneration or the new life which the person baptised has agreed to lead to the glory of God.
        
         
        
        Said St. Paul: “Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized unto his death? Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection. Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin.”-Romans 6: 3-6.
        
         
        
        Again St. Paul stated: “Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, Who hath raised him from the dead.” – Colossians 2: 12.
        
         
        
        The fact, which no one can dispute, is that pouring or sprinkling of water does not bear relevance to the significance of burial with Christ into death neither does it give any idea of resurrection, spiritual or otherwise.
        
         
        
        Baptism of Infants
        
        With regard to the baptism of infants the only authority the priests of certain churches cite is the saying of Jesus Christ: “Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.” But what they often lose sight of is the fact that this statement of our Lord has no connection at all with baptism. The children were brought to him and he did no more than that he blessed them. The full account of this is in Matthew 19: 13-15 and Mark 10: 13-16. There is nothing wrong if the pastors or bishops who preach the truth bless children but they have no authority whatsoever to baptise them.
        
         
        
        Jesus Christ did not baptise any child – not even a single adult. It was his disciples he instructed to baptise the believers. – John 4: 1-3.
        
         
        
        A person must attain the age of reasoning so that he can repent of his sins and be able to express his belief in Jesus Christ before he is baptised. When the eunuch of Ethiopia asked for baptism, Philip told him: “If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest.” And the eunuch answered: “I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.” (Acts 8: 37) It was on the basis of this belief, which the eunuch confessed, that he was baptised. But infants know nothing and so they cannot believe or accept the spiritual responsibility baptism imposes on the person who is baptised. The so-called surety of “godfathers” and “godmothers” is spiritually meaningless.
        
         
        
        We agree that baptism is necessary for salvation but the innocent children should be left alone until they grow up when they can decide to serve God through Jesus Christ. Anyone who receives baptism but does not believe in Christ cannot be saved. Jesus said: “He that BELIEVETH and is baptised shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.” –  Mark 16: 16.
        
         
        
        Baptism, we repeat, does not wash away sin but it is an outward demonstration of one’s conversion and agreement to serve God Almighty faithfully through Jesus Christ all the days of one’s life, in order to obtain salvation. St. Peter stated: “The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ.” – 1 Peter 3: 21.
        
         
        
        It was because of the vital importance of baptism, Jesus Christ commanded his apostles in this wise: “….Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.” – Mark 16: 15, 16.
        
         
        
        We have stated the truth of the matter in this Sermon with the best of intention so that we all may be guided by the light of Jesus Christ and be saved.
        
        In the first place, we wish to correct the wrong view of some Christians who refer to a building as a church. One of the definitions given by The Catholic Encyclopedic Dictionary is that a church is “a place of Christian worship”. Very often we come across publications stating that a certain amount of money has been earmarked or contributed for the building of a church. Or that the foundation stone of a new church to be built at a cost of £10,000 or so, has been or is to be laid by such and such reverend gentleman. Also, we find some people pointing at a building and saying, “This is our church.”
        
         
        
        The Bible does not refer to a house as church. Neither Jesus Christ nor any of his early apostles used the word to mean a building or place of worship. It is because of the continuous wrong usage of the word by priests and theologians that makers of dictionaries have also been biased to misconstrue it in that regard.
        
         
        
        Christian
        
        According to the Scripture, the word church, which was translated from the Greek word ekklesia or ecclesia, means a congregation or body or an assembly of Christians. The word was first used by Jesus Christ as recorded in the eighteenth verse of the sixteenth chapter of the gospel according to St. Matthew. The occasion was when Jesus Christ asked his disciples certain questions, and Peter gave a correct answer. To Peter, he said: “Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven. And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.” – Matthew 16: 13-18.
        
         
        
        That the rock upon which the church is built is not Peter but Jesus Christ who himself is the head of the Church (1 Corinthians 10: 4; Colossians 1: 18) has been proved beyond argument in The Weekly Sermon (Vol. 1, No.9) issue of November 3, 1968. The point we are now making is that Jesus Christ did not use the word church to mean a literal house or place of worship.
        
         
        
        In the Acts of the Apostles, chapter 14, a lucid account is given about how Paul and Barnabas worked unitedly for the furtherance of the gospel of Christ. When they were come to Antioch as stated in verse 27, “and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how He had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles”. The church that was gathered means the Christians, collectively, (not houses) that were assembled! When St. Paul said that “it is a shame for women to speak in the church” (1 Corinthians 14: 34, 35) he was not making reference to a building set aside for worship but to a congregation of Christians
        
         
        
        Furthermore, St Paul wrote in his epistle to the Romans thus: “Likewise greet the church that is in their house… The churches of Christ salute you.” (Romans 16: 5, 16) Can anybody show that the apostle was asking his fellow Christians to greet a house? how can a sane person do that? it is unthinkable! Or can a house, an inanimate object, salute persons? it cannot, except a demon in it. This is just to show how ridiculous and meaningless it will sound if the word church is reduced to mean a place of worship.
        
         
        
        By the clause, “the church that is in their house”, St. Paul meant the disciples of Christ that met in their house. And when he stated “the churches of Christ salute you” he was referring to the congregations of Christian believers. See also 1 Corinthians 16: 19.
        
         
        
        It should be understood, therefore, that our reference to the “true Church” in the caption of this sermon, has to do with a group or body or a society of genuine Christians. The epithet true would have been superfluous if there had not existed groups of professed Christians which are counterfeit.
        
         
        
        Denominations
        
        With regard to the number of church denominations in the world, it is difficult to speak with exactitude. They are very many, and new ones spring up almost everyday. In Nigeria, there were two in particular that did not last long: they were the “Do Me I Do You Church” and “Adam and Eve Church”. The former was founded on the principle of retaliation as enunciated in the laws of Moses. Its members claimed that if they did not return evil for evil, God would be angry in that it was a sin. In the case of “Adam and Eve Church”, nakedness was their doctrine and practice. There is a similar church in England known as “The Guild Church of the Naturian Kindred”. (Vide Sunday Pictorial, May 19, 1957, page 15).
        
         
        
        Considering the degree of variance among the churches in doctrines and methods of worship, it will be a very silly conclusion to say that all of them belong to Jesus Christ and are serving the one true God.
        
         
        
        The Roman Catholic Church claims to be the only true Church, and mother of all others. In a pamphlet entitled, Can I Change My Religion? published by the “Catholic Truth Society” in London, it is stated: “Catholics do not want to change their religion, because they are quite sure that their religion is the true one…. You must accept everything that has been defined by her in the past, and be ready to accept without question anything that she may define in the future.” (Pages 3-4).
        
         
        
        Other church groups do disagree and pooh-pooh the claim of the Roman Catholics which cannot be supported with or proved from the Bible.
        
         
        
        There are some groups in Nigeria and elsewhere whose members’ activities, rather than turning men’s minds to God, are causing some people to reproach Christianity. In some of the groups almost every other member is either an apostle or a prophet or prophetess. Some take pride in high-sounding appellations such as “Senior Apostle”, “Most Senior Apostle” and so on. They prophesy and see visions almost everyday. The visions do not concern the purpose of God and are not such that tend to lead to righteousness but visions about riches or of the women the “spirit” wants them to marry, or of who is a witch and what not.
        
         
        
        It is common knowledge that fornication and adultery are perpetrated in some of these mushroom groups where certain prophets can spend a whole day with women in private rooms under the cover of prayer! Some of these prophets take certain deluded women to rivers where they pretend to wash away their sins and to invoke angels through prayer to drive away devils or demons from them. It is frequently alleged that the prophets strip them stark naked and make immoral advances to them in “holy” water!
        
         
        
        It was during one of their spirit-vision expeditions that some of these prophets killed a certain poor woman in the Western State as published.
        
         
        
        The other day one of their prophets claimed to have seen a vision that the Western State of Nigeria would sink if the people paid more than 7/6 per head as tax; he actually went out to spread this satan-inspired message. But on investigation, it was discovered that the anti-tax preacher had himself paid tax and kept his receipt quite intact. He was of course, justly convicted for 18 months. (Daily Times, February 1, 1969) Since Jesus Christ and his disciples paid tax in his days, do we still need any more proof before we can know that the anti-tax gospeler is a fake?
        
         
        
        Variance
        
        All the churches cannot be true while they are at variance on several points of doctrine, and divided in their methods of worship, we repeat. St. Paul stated: “Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.” (1 Corinthians 1: 10) The fact that some have deviated from the truth of God in the Bible and do not speak the same thing and are divided leaves no room for doubt that such ones only call the name of Christ in pretence.
        
         
        
        False Prophets
        
        Jesus Christ knew very well that false prophets with their characteristic propensity for fantastic claims would proliferate in this age of the last day, and he warned against them. Said he: “And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many. For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect. Behold, I have told you before.” (Matthew 24: 11, 24-25.) Bible students are not surprised to see them and hear of them all over the world. It is a proof that the last day is here!
        
         
        
        Within the past few years the rate at which false Christs sprang up is fantastic. Like a shooting star, they appear suddenly in the mood of sanctimoniousness and, after a short while, fade away into oblivion. Where now is the “Jesus of Oyingbo” (Lagos)? Where is that of France who predicted that the world would end on August 15, 1954? (Vide the Illustrated of May, 1954) and where is that “Jesus of Ogbunike” near Onitsha? One of them claimed to be God and the very Jesus the Son of God, and at the same time he said he was Abraham. Yet some of those who had been stupefied with the strokes of his cane by which he “baptised” his adherents, believed everything he said. God said: “A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land; the prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love to have it so: and what will ye do in the end thereof?” – Jeremiah 5: 30, 31.
        
         
        
        There is no doubt that Nigeria, and the world at large, is in danger of false prophets. They are dangerous because they lead people to destruction. – Isaiah. 9: 16; Matthew 15: 12-14.
        
         
        
        When we examine the root of the encomium or praise and the credit given to certain churches for their achievements we find that they do not relate to the purity of doctrine or the reformation of character in converted souls. Rather, such a praise or credit is based on the number of schools, colleges or hospitals they have established or on the scholarships they have given to people. These institutions are not bad. But they are no standards or qualities by which genuine Christianity can be distinguished. The most important thing is the preaching of the truth of God’s word – the gospel – to the sheep of God so that they may be free from Satan’s works and be saved in God’s Kingdom. – Mark 16: 15-16, 19-20; John 8: 31, 32, 36.
        
         
        
        The pride of certain churches is that they have existed for a very long time. Because of this they regard others which are not as old to be false. On this, we also hold the view that it is not how long but how well. Jesus did say: “But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.” – Matthew 19: 30.
        
         
        
        In order to know which church is true and which is not, we must examine the doctrines and practices of the various groups – using the Holy Bible as our yardstick. Jesus gave this warning: “Beware of false teachers, who come disguised as harmless sheep but are wolves and will tear you apart. You can detect them by the way they act, just as you can identify a tree by its fruit. You need never confuse grapevines with thorn bushes! Or figs with thistles! Different kinds of fruit trees can quickly be identified by examining their fruit. For a variety producing delicious fruit doesn’t produce a kind that is inedible! And a tree producing an inedible variety can’t produce what is good! So the trees having the inedible fruit are chopped down and thrown on the fire. Yes, the way to identify a tree, or a person, is by the kind of fruit produced.” – Matthew 7: 15-20, Living Gospels.
        
         
        
        The Authorised Version puts verse 20 thus: “Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.” Jesus Christ further said: “Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.” -Matthew 7: 21.
        
         
        
        It is wrong, therefore, to accept every church denomination as true and as belonging to Jesus Christ. We must follow strictly the guidelines given in the Scriptures in order not to be deceived especially in these days when many are claiming to be prophets, apostles and prophetesses who see spirits. John the apostle admonished: “Beloved. believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone on into the world.” (1 John 4: 1) And St. Paul also warned: “Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.” – l Thessalonians 5: 21.
        
         
        
        To close our eyes to or ignore the reality of the presence of false churches among us is nothing but self-deceit. Said St. Paul; “Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron; forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth…. ” (1 Timothy 4; 1-5.) Just look around, it will not take you any pains to find the church groups that come under the category of the apostle’s predictive description.
        
         
        
        True Church
        
        The fruit by which we can know the true Church is not the doing of wonders, seeing of visions, dreaming of dreams or the saying of many prayers but the preaching of the TRUTH in particular, and the showing of Christian love. (John 13: 34,35) False prophets can do wonders, see visions and do some other things, but they CAN NEVER preach the TRUTH without adulterating it. (Matthew 7: 20-23) Once the doctrine of any religious body is tainted with a lie that group is not a true church. St. John stated “that no lie is of the truth”. (1 John 2: 21) It was on this ground St. Paul wrote to Timothy: “If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness; he is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings, perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself.” – 1 Timothy 6: 3-5.
        
         
        
        The trouble with many people is that they take things for granted. They do not care to ascertain whether what they are taught to believe in the churches are in harmony with the holy scripture. For example, the teaching that St. Peter is the head of the church is not true; JESUS CHRIST IS THE HEAD. (Ephesians 5: 22,23) The teaching that the soul is immortal is wrong; the baptism of infants is unchristian, and the teaching that baptism washes away sins is unscriptural; the teaching that women are ordained by God to preach the gospel is unbiblical. There are a lot of other false doctrines and beliefs which space will not permit us to mention here.
        
         
        
        Any church denomination, or even an angel from heaven, that teaches any doctrine unsupported in the Scripture, has no right to claim to be the true church. Said St. Paul: “But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed…” – Galatians 1: 8, 9.
        
         
        
        The true Church, therefore, is the Christian Organisation in any part of the world that preaches the truth, nothing but the whole truth, as contained in the Holy Bible. Jesus said to the Jews who believed on him: “If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.” (John 8: 31, 32) It is the truth that will bring us the salvation of God, but the absence of it means the loss of everything good.
        
         
        
        As we must be honest and true to ourselves and other persons of goodwill toward God, we cannot hide the fact that the God’s Kingdom Society (GKS) is preaching the truth which has enlightened many people and brought them God’s blessings; she is therefore -like any other church organisation preaching the truth-the true Church of Christ. Some may frown upon this claim but the onus of proof rests upon them to show from the Scriptures (not their opinions) that we are not. And where they cannot let them say, as commanded by God, “It is truth.”-Isaiah. 43: 9; see also John 8: 45, 46.

         content:`The fact that some men who perpetrate wickedness are found among the rich and prosperous people of this evil world make some ask as to why God distributes His blessings indiscriminately. But Christians who understand the ways of God know that it is the devil, the god of this world, and NOT God Almighty, that prospers the wicked. God only permits the wicked to live in order to afford them the opportunity to repent; but where they do not, He visits their iniquities upon them suddenly and sentences them to perpetual destruction.
         The wicked in the context of this subject are people who are evil in principle and in practice, or those who offend intentionally against what is right or the law of God. Such people, in the language of the Scriptures, “drink iniquity like water”. They do not acknowledge God. They are shameless and corrupt. In fact, they are a people who are governed by selfish ambition and are without conscience, being filled with every kind of evil. They steal and commit murder directly or through agents; they also commit adultery and fornication without remorse. To them pride is a virtue; they are arrogant and boastful. And they oppress the poor and take away from the needy their right.
         
         It is a common experience among men that many of such wicked people appear to get on well in life: they amass wealth and live long. Their wives and children grow fat being well nourished and they enjoy good health. But in contrast with the case of the wicked, we have seen that many of those who are upright in heart, who love to serve God and who keep peace in the land find life hard; they and their families are often plagued with ill-health and plunged into trouble from time to time. And some of them who are faring well and who are kind, charitable and of immense services to humanity, are often snatched away by death in the flower of their age.
         
         It was such experience as this that caused the well-known novelists and essayist, Daniel Defoe (1661-1731), to write: “The good die early, and the bad die late.”
         There are instances in which thieves being pursued ran through places where there were thorns and broken bottles and escaped unhurt while those chasing them were injured at such places to the extent that they were hospitalized and even some, consequently, died! Why such things in which innocent ones suffer should happen in this world is a puzzle to many people.
         
         It was King Solomon who said: “All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness.” – Ecclesiastes 7:15.
         It is a fool that will think that simply because he lives longer than another man he is more righteous or better. They worth of a man’s life is judged not by how long he lived but by how well to the glory of God and for the benefit of mankind. In his “The Bee”, Thomas Osbert Mordaunt (1730-1809) stated:
         
         “One crowded hour of glorious life
         Is worth an age without a name.”
         Character
         The character of the wicked, their way of life and prosperity as well as their end are clearly shown in the Holy Scriptures. Concerning them Job said: “Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power? Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes. Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod (punishment) of God upon them. Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf. They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance. They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ. They spend their days in wealth; Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us for we desire not the knowledge of Thy ways. What is the Almighty, that we should serve Him? And what profit should we have, if we pray unto Him?” – Job 21:7-15.
         Some people envy the wicked and are tempted to imitate them when they find that they (the wicked) get on despite their evil deeds. The Psalmist who was a prophet of God was similarly tempted in his days but when he went into the sanctuary of God, then he understood the vanity of the prosperity of the wicked. He stated: “But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped. For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked. For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is firm. They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like other men. Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth them as a garment. Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish. They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression: they speak loftily. They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth – And they say, How doth God know? And is there knowledge in the most High? Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in riches.” – Psalm, 73:2-12.
         The Psalmist as an honest and God-fearing man. So when he got to know that the wicked with their wealth were doomed to destruction, he confessed his foolishness and ignorance for envying them. He said: “When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me; until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end. Surely Thou didst set them in slippery places: Thou castedst them down into destruction. How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! They are utterly consumed with terrors; So foolish was I, and ignorant” – Psalm, 73:16-22.
         
         Corruption
         There are people who become rich through stealing. The Bible says, “The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure” (Job 12:6). And there are some who indulge in bribery and corruption and other ungodly acts to acquire riches. But they do not know that such riches are under curse. In Job 15:34-35 it is written: “For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery. They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit.”
         
         Moreover, it is also stated in Proverbs 3:33, thus: “The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but He blesseth the habitation of the just.”
         Is it not true that certain people also become rich through oppression? They employ the poor to work for them but sometimes refuse to pay the labourers’ wages. This is a grievous sin before God, and when such poor ones who are oppressed cry to Him, He will certainly plead their cause and take vengeance on the wicked. Concerning such rich men, James the apostle stated: “Next a word to you who have great possessions. Weep and wail over the miserable fate descending on you. Your riches have rotted; your fine clothes are moth-eaten; your silver and gold have rusted away; and their very rust will be evidence against you and consume your flesh like fire. You have piled up wealth in an age that is near its close. They wages you never paid to the men who mowed your fields are loud against you, and the outcry of the reapers has reached the ears of the Lord of Hosts. You have lived on earth in wanton luxury, fattening yourselves like cattle- and the day for slaughter has come. You have condemned the innocent and murdered him; her offers no resistance.” – James. 5: 1-6. New English Bible.
         
         Also, in Jeremiah 22:13, it is written: “Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by wrong; that useth his neighour’s service without wages, and giveth him not for his work.”
         The riches of the wicked are not from God but from Satan the devil who is the arch-enemy of God and men. The Bible says that God is angry with the wicked every day and will, in His own due time, make them reap the reward of their doings. – Psalm. 7:9-16; Isaiah. 3:11.
         The devil makes the wicked rich and instills in them the feeling of self-sufficiency which induces them to blaspheme and to continue in doing evil. “The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined. For the wicked boasteth of his heart’s desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom the LORD abhoreth. The wicked through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts. His ways are always grievous; Thy judgements are far above out of his sight: as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them. He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shall never be in adversity. His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue is mischief and vanity.” – Psalm. 10:2-7.
         
         Punishment
         The reasons why many people commit acts of wickedness is that those who do such things are not always killed by God immediately. This was lucidly explained by Solomon when he said: “Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil. Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before Him: but it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth not before God.” – Ecclesiastes. 8:11-13.
         We can understand from the foregoing that though the days of the wicked may be prolonged, he can never escape the punishment of God. “His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins. He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.” – Proverbs 5:22, 23.
         It is a glaring fact that the riches and joys of the wicked are counterfeit and transitory. Instances of this fact have been seen. In Job 20: 4-9, 29, it is written: “Knowest thou not this of old, since man was placed upon the earth, that the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment? Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds; yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say, Where is he? This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God.”
         We can appreciate, therefore, why the people of God are admonished not to envy sinners. (Proverbs 3:31; 23:17) David the Psalmist said: “Fret not thyself because of evidoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity. For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb. Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for him; fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.” (Psalm 37:1-3, 7) David then went on to speak of his experience in his days, saying: “I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree. Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found. Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is peace.” – verses 35-37.`,

         “His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins. He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.” – Proverbs 5:22, 23.

         Forgiveness
         God does not want the wicked man to die in his wickedness; rather He wants him to put away evil and do righteousness. At it is written: “Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and He will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon.” – Isaiah. 55:7.
         
         Left to us humans, we may desire that everyone who commits wickedness should be slain at once. But God does not want it so and we should do His wish or will always.
         The Almighty knows that not all people are deliberately wicked; there are some who become wicked, not just because they were born wicked, but out of circumstances owing to human frailty or through the influence of the devil and evil men; such ones can repent. And God said: “But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die. All his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be mentioned unto him: in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live. Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? Saith the Lord GOD: and not that he should return from his ways, and live?” Ezekiel 18:21-23; see also Job 33:27-30.
         The point, which is very important, is that the wicked man or sinner must acknowledge and be sorry for his sins before he can obtain the Lord’s mercy. His penitence should not be a matter of mere oral declaration but a real change of heart which must be manifest in deeds.
         If God is to kill everyone who sins immediately, not a single soul among the descendants of Adam will remain on earth because they are all sinners and it is in order to redeem them from sin Jesus Christ the righteous came to the world to give his life as a ransom. The Psalmist said: “If Thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand? But there is forgiveness with Thee, that Thou mayest be feared.” – Psalm 130:3,4.
         
         Long-suffering of God
         The reason why God allows wicked people to live is to give them time to realize their faults and repent of their sins so as to be saved. St. Peter in his second epistle testified to this and spoke of the long-suffering of the Almighty God. He stated: “The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some men count slackness; but is long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance,” – 2nd Peter 3:9.
         But a wicked man who, in spite of the warning of God through the gospel, proves to be stubborn and does not repent, will be destroyed in the end – Isaiah 1:18-20; Romans 2:5-9; 2 Thessalonians. 2:11,12.
         We are not saying that all prosperous persons are wicked. We do know that there are many people who, by dint of hard work and honest labour, are prospered by God and they are in peace. Concerning such blessing of God it is written: “The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and He addeth no sorrow with it.” – Proverbs 10:22.
         
         Our christian admonition, therefore, is that everyone should take to an honest labour and do righteousness so as to be prospered by the Most High. Let those who have been led into the errors of the wicked turn from their evil ways and show a genuine proof of repentance or contrition by serving god in truth through Jesus Christ our Saviour. The door of salvation is still open to them. Jesus Christ said: “I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.” – Matthew 9:10-13.
         What is more, Elihu, explaining how God deals with men, said: “Then He (God) sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded. He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity. If they obey and serve Him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures. But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.” – Job 36:9-12.
         It has been made abundantly clear in this Sermon that God does not bless or prosper wicked people. Any wicked rich man who reads or hears the reading of this Sermon is advised to repent and serve God justly in truth so that he may truly enjoy his wealth and be saved.`,

         content:`No person can find a place in the everlasting and blissful Kingdom of God UNLESS he or she not only understands His will but also endeavours to do it. A man may claim to be holy or appear to be religious – saying prayers times without number, claiming to see visions or have dreams of God, going about in white robes, and so on – and yet be ignorant, very ignorant, as to what the will of God is. So while it means one thing to call God’s name it is quite another matter to do His will.

         The word will in the context of this sermon may be defined as meaning “desire” or “purpose”. It is of utmost necessity that a Christian should in the first instance know the will of God. For without this knowledge it will be impossible to do the pleasure of the Almighty Father. This, as a matter of fact, emphasizes the vital importance of knowledge. Yes, King Solomon stated: “Also, that the soul be without knowledge, it is not good” – Proverbs 19:2; see also Hosea 4:6.
         God Almighty through the operation of his spirit in the prophets of old, Jesus Christ His beloved Son and his apostles, caused His will or purpose or desire, which men need to know and do to be clearly expressed in the Book of books – the Holy Bible.
         In it there are divine laws and judgements through which we are able to know the things God allows His worshippers to do and those He forbids. Concerning the laws of God, Moses the prophet told the Israelites: “Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall ehar all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people” – Deuteronomy 4:6.
         
         Also, there are in the Bible records of important events, which served as types of future things that God would do and which were designed to teach great lessons for the spiritual benefit of Christians in this last days – the most turbulent age in human history. In regard to such ancient happenings among the people of God, St. Paul wrote: “Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.” – 1st Corinthians 10: 11; see also Romans 15: 4.
         Apart from the psalms or songs of knowledge, the proverbs and other wise sayings in the Holy Scripture, there are prophecies and revelations of the sublime purpose of God towards mankind. And St. Peter stated: “We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts: for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men .of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.” – 2 Peter 1: 19,21.
         
         Commandments
         The doing of the will of God therefore calls for the keeping of His commandments and working in accordance with His purpose. King David delared: “I delight to do Thy will, O my God: yea, Thy law is within my heart.” (Psalm, 40: 8) This is true of everyone who is a faithful worshipper of God but more particularly David’s declaration was prophetic and typical of Jesus Christ’s determination to fulfil his mission on earth as purposed by the Almighty Father. – Hebrews 10: 7-10.
         While Jesus Christ was on earth he lived up to expectation, and his resolution to do his Father’s will was manifest both in his utterances and deeds. He said: “I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.” – John 5: 30.
         After Jesus Christ had declared himself as the bread of life, he said that all those whom his Father had given him would certainly come to him; and whoever came to him he would in no wise cast out. He then added; “For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of Him that sent me.” -John 6: 35-38.
         Furthermore, Jesus Christ told his disciples: “My meat is to do the will of Him that sent me, and to finish His work.” – John 4: 34.
         
         Throughout the life of Jesus Christ on earth there was never a moment he fell away from allegiance to his Father, the Almighty God. Even at the crucial time of his crucifixion- that moment of the supreme test of fidelity-he maintained his subjection to the Will of the Father. Under the grip of human feelings consequent upon the persecutions of the wicked, Jesus prayed: “O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as Thou wilt.” And he prayed the second time, thus: “0 my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, Thy will be done.” (Matthew, 26: 38- 42) And because it was the will of the Father he was killed. Thus he tasted death for the redemption of humankind.
         He is not a Christian who does not submit himself like Jesus Christ to the will of God. As a matter of fact, it will be impossible to attain the required degree of excellence in the practice of righteousness without following the example of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ who attached great importance to the doing of his Father’s will. – John 8: 29, 31, 32, 36; Matthew, 5: 20; Hebrews 12: 1-3.
         On a certain occasion Mary, his mother and others of her children caused his speech to be interrupted because they wanted to speak to him. Someone in the c row d informed Jesus about this, but he turned to the man who brought the message and sa i d: “Who is my mother? and who are my brethren? And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren! For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.” – Matthew, 12:46-50.
         
         Men-pleasers
         It is because many people who claim to be worshipping God today do not really understand His will, that they have set at naught His commandments and trampled upon the principles of Christianity. Many of the priests and pastors who ought to lead the people in the path of truth and righteousness are themselves visionless or without understanding and they having been overreached by Satan do neglect their spiritual duties and are so spineless that they are be- come men-pleasers.
         The other day, in this country a “juju festival” – a carnival of the pagans was reported to have ended with a church service at the place of worship belonging to one of the denominations in the main stream of orthodox Christendom. No true Christian can see such things without developing a feeling of revulsion in total condemnation. It was St. Paul who stated: “Can light consort with darkness? Can Christ agree with Belial, or a believer join hands with an unbeliever? Can there be a compact between the temple of God and the idols of the heathen?” – Read 2 Corinthians 6: 14-18. New English Bible.
         
         There are also instances in which certain prominent churchgoers only for socIal advantages, undergo pagan rites and ceremonies so as to obtain chieftaincy titles. Some of these peo- ple who too profess to be Christians are brought to kneel before certain shrines to be blessed by juju priests and so forth. And in order to give the whole show a veneer of modernity, they also end up with a church service where certain “clerks in holy orders” who also pose as the servants of God and ambassadors of Christ give their share of ‘blessing’.
         And there are cases of burial ceremonies, for which there can be no scriptural justification, that are allowed to be connected with church services.
         Many people in this time of the last days are like the naturaI Jews who were enthusiastic in the service of God but for the fact that they did not know His will as shown by Jesus Christ in truth and faith, they practised their own righteousness instead of that of God. St. Paul wrote about them in this vein: “Brethren, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved. For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God but not according to knowledge. For they, being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.” – Romans 10: 1-3.
         
         Nominal Christians
         No one should deceive himself as to think that whatever he docs in the name of God Almighty and Christ Jesus receives Their blessing. One may be called a “president”, a “prophet of the most holy order”, a “Senior Apostle”, a “vicar of Christ” and suchlike, and yet be as far from God as Satan the devil himself is if one’s claims are not based on truth as contained in the H0LY Scripture. And the mere fact that anyone claims to see vision or have a dream of God, or purports to do wonclers or heal the sick in the name of Christ does not in any way make him a prophet of God or qualify him to enter His Kingdom. What is important is the doing of the will of the Almighty Father.
         Jesus Christ, knowing what false prophets and nominal Christians would do in his name simply to gain the praise of men and to deceive the gullible, said: “Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesised in thy name? And in thy name have cast out devils? And in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.” – Matthew, 7:21-23.
         It is clearly stated in the Bible that even our prayers cannot be answered unless we say them in accordance with the will of God. “And this is the confidence that we have in Him, that, if we ask any thing according to His will, He heareth us: and if we know that He hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of Him.” – 1st John 5:14-15.
         The need to understand the will of God, therefore, cannot be overstated. Exhorting the Roman Christians as to how they should dedicate themselves to the service of God, St. Paul stated: “And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.” – Romans 12:1, 2.
         
         And in St. Paul’s epistle to the Ephesians, he wrote: “Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is. And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit.” – Ephesians 5:17, 18.
         The will of God therefore is associated with the practice of all righteouness. Whatever conforms to the word of God as contained in the scriptures is His will. Thus the Holy Bible serves as a guide for Christians in determining what the will of God is. And the Psalmist said: “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.” – Psalm, 119: 105; see also Proverbs 6:23.
         There is blessing in doing the will of God. Jesus made it plain that it is those who do the will of the Almighty Father, will inherit His Kingdom. And John the apostle stated: “And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever” – in God’s Kingdom. – 1st John 2:17.`,

         content:`In the life and teachings of Jesus Christ our Redeemer and Saviour are portrayed all that make for a true disciple of his. And according to the Scriptures, it is one’s heart condition, which must be right with God, and one’s ability by God’s power to translate the vital beliefs and the high ideals of Christianity into practice that is of greater importance than our verbal confession of the faith.

         Today, there are very many people who call themselves Christians and who do not by any standard deserve to bear the name. Several times we have made it known in black and white that nominal Christians are in the majority. This is a fact which no one is apt to dispute if only people know what it means, according to the Bible, to be a Christian.
         It is amusing to find certain people who are idolaters claiming to be Christians and swearing to the Bible in the name of God in the law courts. They feel it is more modern and honorable to identify themselves as Christians in public. And if the police were asked to search these people there would be a lot of shameful nasty finds such as “demonized small calabashes in pockets, and chains of fetishistic cowries tied around the waists of some.” Yet in spite of all these identification marks of devilism, they still wish to be associated with Jesus Christ. This has made pagans to have very low opinion of certain so called Christians.
         
         There are some others who after swearing to the Bible in the name of God resort to telling of blatant lies, bearing false witness against their neighbour contrary to God’s commandments in the very Bible they had sworn to and licked. Will it be right to call such people Christians? Of course, it will not. Pagans who take pagan. oaths are sincere and are better than the so-called Christians who worship idols and still parade themselves as Christians.
         But for the mercies of God and His exercise of the attribute of longsuffering, many people would have turned to pillars of salt or wood in the witness boxes for taking His name in vain. Unless such people take warning and sincerely repent of their sins, the curse of God would remain upon them. The divine law, which, since the days of Moses the prophet, has been in force till this Christian era, is: “Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh His name in vain.” (Exodus. 20: 7.) In the Bible which some swear to, Jesus Christ said his disciples should not swear at all. (Matthew, 5: 33-37; James. 5: 12) What they should do is to affirm in the court or tribunal that the evidence they will give is the truth, and they should really say the truth.
         
         Nominal Christians
         Now, let us direct our minds to those who attend church services. Can it be denied that there are many of them having some form of fetish under their beds, or hung above their doors or hidden somewhere in their rooms? Do some not take part in pagan ceremonies and festivals? Do they not vie with heathens for chieftaincy titles or associate with them in secret cults? Such people are not Christians though they may be deceiving themselves. “No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.” (Matthew, 6: 24) And what is more St. Paul stated: “Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? And what communion hath light with darkness? And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?”-2nd Corinthians 6: 14, 15.
         No one can be a true servant of God and at the same time be a worshipper of idols and/or devils. The moment one turns to idolatry he ceases to be a worshipper of God. St. Paul said, “Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord’s table, and of the table of devils.”- 1st Corinthians 10: 21.
         
         Certain Christians so-called have no faith. For every threat of temptation they waver between two opinions (1 Kings 18: 21), and whenever they experience the vicissitudes of life they doubt Christ’s power to help or to save, and run to witch-doctors and idols to seek aid. In a sense, the pagans who remain steadfast to their idol-worship are better than nominal Christians who for lack of spiritual understanding and faith ‘cross the carpet’ over to idolatry and thus cause reproach. To such faithless Christians the words of Paul the apostle of Christ do apply: ” Thou that abhorreth idols, dost thou commit sacrilege? Thou that maketh thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonoreth thou God? For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.”-Romans 2:22-24.
         Every understanding Christian ought to know that idols are vain things which could not be relied upon for help or safety. The Psalmist declared: “Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God? But our God is in the heavens: He hath done whatsoever He bath pleased. Their (pagans’) idols are silver and gold, the work of men’s hands. They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they see not: they have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they smell not: they have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they walk not: neither speak they through their throat. They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that trusteth in them.”-Psalm, 115: 2-8.
         It is not just everyone who professes to be a Christian that is truly a follower of Jesus Christ. Our Saviour himself said: “Not everyone that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into tho kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. Many will say to me in that day (of decision), Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? And in thy name have cast out devils? And in thy name done many wonderful Works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.”-Matthew, 7: 21-23.
         From the words of Jesus Christ just quoted it becomes clear that many of those who parade themselves as prophets and who claim to see visions, dream dreams and engage in “divine” healings or do wonders in his name do not derive their powers from him (Jesus) but from Satan the devil.
         
         Vital Qualities
         A Christian, therefore, is a believer in Jesus Christ who not only understands the will of God but also does it. In all essential aspects of life, he must endeavour to be like our Master, Jesus the righteous. Christ said: “It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his Lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household?” – Matthew, 10:25.
         In order to be like Jesus Christ we must have vital qualities such as love, faith and understanding, and be equipped with the knowledge and wisdom, not of the world, but of God. With these we can, by the grace of God, ever stand for and proclaim the truth of Christ notwithstanding the oppositions of gainsayers and the persecutions of the enemies of righteousness. A Christian should be humble, meek and tolerant. He must never compromise with evil but shun it. St. Paul stated: “Abstain from all appearance of evil.” – 1st Thessalonians 5: 22. To be a Christian indeed requires a lot of sacrifice. Under no circumstance must he allow human or worldly considerations to override the demands of Jesus Christ. If the wishes of his parents or wife or relatives or whoever it may be, are in conflict with the requirements of Jesus Christ, he must at all times abandon the wishes of men and cleave to the Lord by doing his will even if this would offend his parents and so on. Jesus Christ said: “He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthY of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.” -Matthew, 10: 37.38. When on a certain occasion a multitude of people; followed Jesus Christ during his first advent. he turned to them and said: “If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple. And whosoever doth .not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple.”-Luke 14: 25.27. Christ did not mean that every Christian should just hate his parents or children and so forth without cause. It is when the parents or wife or brothers are wicked or if they are opposers of the truth of Christ, and therefore constituting an obstacle to his doing the will of God that he would shun them. If he does not, it will be him that lose his precious life in the end.
         The cross that a Christian is required to bear is not a golden or wooden instrument nor is it a piece of brass or copper but the self-denial he must show and without which he cannot live up to expectation in the Lord. He must do away with the lust of the flesh and make efforts seriously to live a quiet and sober life, and above all, a life of holiness. Sinful and worldly things in which he might have been taking great pleasure before his conversion to Christianity, he must disregard and treat as things of the past. Paul the apostle had such experience, and he said: “But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ. Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ, and te found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith.” – Philippians 3: 7-9.
         
         New Creature
         To be a Christian means to refrain from the life of sin. “Therefore if any man be in Christ,” said St. Paul, “he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become Dew.”
         (2nd Corinthians 5: 17) The old things that are gone are the works of the flesh some of which were recounted by the same apostle in his epistle to the Christians at Galatia. As it is written: “Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunken ness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.”-Galatians 5: 19-21.
         But turning to the qualities of true Christians who are under the control of the Spirit of God, St. Paul further stated: “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law And they that are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts. If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another. “-Galatians 5: 22-26.
         We agree that Jesus Christ came to die for sinners but he did not die that sinners may continue to sin. Rather he came to call sinners to repentance so that through his death the repentant ones may obtain forgiveness of sins and everlasting life in God’s perfect Government.-Matthew, 9: 10-13; 20: 28; Luke 24: 47; Acts 13: 38, 39, etc.
         Furthermore, St. Peter stated: “Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin; that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God. For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banqueting, and abominable idolatries: wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you: who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick (living) and the dead.” -I Pet. 4: 1-5.
         
         Therefore, exhorting the Christians, St. Paul wrote: “Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence and covetousness, which is idolatry: for which things’sake, the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience: in the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them. But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth. Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds; and have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him: where there is neither Greek nor Jew. Circumcision nor un-circumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all.” – Colossians 3: 5-11; see also Ephesians 4: 17.:’2; 5: 1-11.
         As a good, loving wife is faithful to her husband or a good loving husband is faithful to his wife, so must a Christian who truly loves Jesus Christ be faithful to him. To serve mm (Jesus) and at the same time do ungodly or heathenish things or serve idols amounts to unfaithfulness on the part of such ones and it is spiritual adultery.
         Anyone who examines himself against the background of all the Scriptures that have been expounded in this Sermon will know whether he is a nominal Christian or not. And if anyone is only a Christian in name and not in deed, he should pray to God to help him amend his ways. It is “not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified”. (Romans 2: 13; James. 1 : 22-25) And Jesus Christ said: “If ye love me, keep my commandments.” (John 14: 15) Anyone who does not keep Christ’s commandments is not a Christian, he does not know God or Christ.
         As it is written: “.. He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.”-1st John 2: 3-5.`,
          title:"What It Means To Be A Christian!"},
      {key:5,
         content:`“NEVERTHELESS man being in honour and abideth not is like..” as the Scriptures written under divine inspiration gives the understanding that except man lives up to the purpose for which God Almighty created him, he is good-for-nothing.
         In the context of this treatise we are discoursing man as meaning a human being or person or the human race.
         
         Among the creation of God on earth man is accorded a place of pre-eminence though he was the last to be created. After all other things had been made God said to His creative agent, the archangel, who later came to the earth and was known as Jesus Christ, thus: “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth ,upon the earth.” – Genesis 1: 26.
         The Genesis account further states: “So God created man in His own image, God created He him; male and female created He them. And God blessed them, and God said unto them, be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, all over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.” And God said, “Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so” – Genesis 1: 27-30.
         Concerning man, The American Peoples Encyclopedia states: “He is distinguished frin the image ofom other Jiving: creatures by a number of distinct features, among which is his larger and more efficient brain, which enables him to learn more effectively through experiences, to reason logically, and to create new ideas, and to use means other than his biological attributes for dealing with his environment. Man is capable of passing the results of his experience from one gene- ration to the next and using the results of this cumulative experience, or culture, to improve his means of obtaining food, shelter, and other necessities, and to develop his artistic expressions.” (Vol. 12, Page 922)
         
         Relationship
         There is no doubt that God has a closer relationship with man than with all other creatures on earth. It is His’ purpose that man whom He made in His image and gave attributes such as wisdom, power, justice and love, should worship and praise Him. Said He: “This people nave .I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise.” -Isaiah 43: 21.
         In order that man may be properly guided as to fulfil the purpose for which he was created, God gave him rules and principles to keep. The laws of God therefore, are of vital importance in the life of man. When the natural Jews had suffered severe hunger in the wilderness during their journey to Canaan, Moses, the prophet, told them that God had subjected them to that test so that He might make them know that “man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live”.- Deuteronomy 8:- 2, 3; see also Matthew 4: 4.
         Writing about “Man’s destiny”, Dr. R. S. Wallace expressed this view: “In the Genesis account of creation; God, when He creates man, is regarded as taking up an attitude of deeper personal concern for him. God approaches man and addresses him as a ‘thou’, and man is made to respond to God’s gracious word in personal love and trust. Only in this response, can man be what be truly is.” (The New Bible Dictionary, emphasis ours).
         But it is a pity that very many people are hopelessly ignorant of this plain truth that it is by man’s response or’ obedience to God’s gracious word that he can be what he truly is in God’s order of things. Today people talk of the achievements of man in various fields of learning. The advance made in science and technology has brought about the invention of many things for the comfort,”” and pleasure- of man – though not without abuses.
         These achievements, most of which are artificial, have led not a few men to be over- ambitious, and to develop a feeling of self-sufficiency with the result that they have no place for God in their thoughts and doings. A certain man, once said that he did not believe in God but that he believed in man and what man can do. Funny enough, people of such mentality are found mostly among those whom the world honours as “intellectuals”. Their sport is blasphemy and desecration of holy things.
         
         Vanity
         No matter the height of man’s greatness in knowledge, wealth, or might, he cannot do Without depending Oil God Almighty if he is to make the most of life. When a man is in power and thinks only of his material success and the ex- tent of his influence over his fellow men, he sometimes becomes full of himself, inflated with pride and arrogance, and deceived in his heart as to have no re- course to God. But the end has always manifested the frailty and mortali1y (If man and justified the supremacy of the Most High in whose hands is the life of all mankind.
         Let us take the case of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, for an example. There is no doubt that by human standards he was a great man. And Daniel the prophet told him that he had “grown and become strong: for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth”. But when he resorted to boasting of his power and achievement without acknowledging God, he was reduced to nothing “to the intent that the living may know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever He will, and setleth up over it the basest of men”.-Daniel 4: 17, 22,28-33.
         While Nebuchadnezzar was strutting and vaunting in his palace, a voice from heaven said to him: “The kingdom is departed from thee.” And it added: “And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field: they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men. and giveth it to whomsoever He will.”-Verses 31,32.
         In that same hour Nebuchadnezzar lost all the faculties of a rational being and was made like a brute going on all fours. He “did eat grass as oxen, .and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles’ feathers, and his nails like birds’ claws”.-Verse 33.
         
         When the period of his punishment had expired God made him regain his senses and also the glory of his kingdom. It was at that time Nebuchadnezzar realised that human glory and greatness-minus God !– is nothing but vanity. As it is written: “And at the end of the days. I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and honoured Him that liveth for .ever, Whose dominion is an everlasting ,dominion, and His kingdom is from generation to generation: and all the inhabitants .of the earth are reputed as nothing: and He doeth according to His will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay His hand, or say unto Him, What doest thou? …Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven, all whose ‘Works are truth, and His ways judgment: and those that walk in pride He is able to abase.”–Daniel 4: 34-37.
         Furthermore, we can also learn from the experience of king Herod who was notorious for persecuting the early Christians. He killed James the apostle and imprisoned St. Peter. Despite the fact that his people gave him extraordinary honour, God showed that his pomp and glory were counterfeit; and his end was miserable. Concerning him, it is written: “And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne, and made an oration unto them. And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god, and not of a man. And immediately the angel of the Lord ‘smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost.” -Acts 12: 21-23.
         There is no cause at all for man to think above himself if he realises that he is nothing but dust. King David in his psalms declared: “LORD, what is man, that Thou takest knowledge of him! or the son of man, that Thou makest account of him! Man is like to vanity: his days are as a shadow that passeth away.” – Psalm 144: 3,4; see also Psalm 8: 3-4.
         
         Man’s Life
         The knowledge of God made His faithful worshippers of old understand the brevity ‘and vanity of human life; and it _helped – them a great deal to contain themselves within the bounds of God’s judgments and laws with holy fear. David, the prophet and king, in one of his sober – and prayerful meditations considered the various aspects of man and the short span of man’s life on earth, which he compared to the breadth of four fingers, and arrived at the conclusion that man at his best-whether when he is young. and strong, handsome and full of health, or whether in wealth and honour – is vanity.
         He said: “LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is; that I may know how frail I am. Behold, Thou hast made my days as an handbreadth; and mine age is as nothing before Thee: verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity. Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them. And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in Thee. Deliver me from a1l my transgressions: make me not the reproach of the foolish.” – Psalm 39: 3-8.
         If only people will reason in the way David did and understand the emptiness of man, they will have cause to be sober and to humble themselves under the mighty hand of Jehovah, the Almighty God. From time to time in all of human history, God had allowed certain incidents, to take place so that man may know what really he is, and not over-exercise himself. But the pity of it is, that many people do not learn from such incidents as to behave responsibly in the fear of God.
         
         Only a few days ago, a tragic accident of a plane crash in which all 87 persons on board lost their lives, occurred in Nigeria. Among the victims were people who fared well in life, men and women in the prime of their youth; but the means that. they considered would afford them the best of comfort and make them reach their destination within the shortest time was the Instrument that sent them to their graves. And it was reported that the Nigeria Airways VC-IO aircraft crashed three minutes before it was due to touch down at Ikeja airport, Lagos. What a tragedy! It was King Solomon who said: “For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the bird’s that are caught in the snare; so are the sons of men soared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them.” (Ecclesiastes 9: 12) However, Christians have hope in the resurrection of the dead a’1d so we believe the VC-I0-aircraft-crabh victims shall rise in the resurrection of the dead.-John 5: 28, 29; Acts 24: 15.
         The woes of man-sinful, mortal man-are manifold. Job stated: “Man that is born of a woman’ is of few days, and full of trouble. He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.”
         (Job. 14: 1.2) And St. Peter said: “For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away, but the word of the Lord endureth for ever…”-! Pet. 1: 24, 25.
         
         King Solomon had a good understanding of the nature, physical characteristics and other aspects of man, and he wrote under inspiration: “I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts. For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity. All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.” – Ecclesiastes 3: 18-20.
         Dignity However, what makes man better than the beasts is the fact that he is made in the image and likeness of God being a person endowed with divine qualities which have been corrupted through sin; and he also has the hope of resurrection through the promise of God which beasts do not have. It is when men have this knowledge and lead a life of holiness to the glory of God that they can retain the honour and dignity that is theirs; but where they do otherwise then they are like beasts that perish. – Psalm 49: 12,20.
         It is our exhortation, therefore, that people should fear God and give glory to him. And what is more King Solomon also said: “Fear God and keep His commandments: for this is the whole duty of man. For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing whether it be good, or whether it be evil.” (Ecclesiastes 12: 13,14; see also Revelation 14: 6, 7.) Indeed, man without God is nothing but vanity -a hopeless entity-yes, he is like the beasts that perish!`,

         content:`ONE of the greatest periods in the history of the world is that parabolically referred to by Jesus Christ as HARVEST. And it is in the context of that parable of our Saviour, which has relation to the gathering of the sheep of God into His Organisation, that harvest is of significance to true Christians. But the pity of it is that, today, some people who profess to be the disciples of Christ have redefined harvest in tendentious terms of commercialism in the name of God.
         Harvest means the reaping in of grain or other farm products; or the season for doing this. It is used both literally and figuratively in the Scripture.
         Many people have been asking to know why the God’s Kingdom Society does not hold harvest thanksgiving services as some churches do and whether it is commanded in the Holy Bible that harvest should be observed by Christians.
         Without mincing words and without fear of criticism we must say that harvest festival is not a Christian institution neither are Christians commanded to celebrate it. That apart, the way the churches observe it is very unscriptural. There is nothing wrong in devising ways and means of making collections for the upkeep of a church organization but this must be done without the appearance of sin and must be in accordance with the Scriptures as ordained by God.
         In certain church organizations, harvest is observed annually as a church festival during which money, flowers and fruits are brought to church services as thank-offering. Harvest festival is regarded as an occasion for raising of funds for church denominations. Special envelopes are printed and given out to members and non-members to solicit for donations. Such envelopes are also sent to the known wives of their polygamous members whom they do not allow to participate in the holy communion. In view of their tendency to get much money, bazaars are commonly organized to form part of the celebrations. Goods are sold at grossly excessive prices. For example, a tuber of yam costing about three shillings may be offered for sale at an unduly high prices.
         
         The pastors or catechists or some other prominent church-men often act as salesmen on such occasions. They describe the goods being sold as having special blessing of heaven so that they are worth more than any amount of money anyone can offer for them. It is usually a time the rich make a parade of their wealth because the occasions in most cases take the form of an auction where the articles are sold to the highest of successive bidders.
         A poor man may offer two shillings for a bunch of banana, the salesman holding an auctioneer’s mallet will not let his hammer go down until someone else has offered 20 shillings and sometimes a third person takes it up with an offer of three guineas and perhaps a fourth person, wishing to show himself as a man of substance and in order to earn the praise of men, will wade in with an offer of 20 guineas. Of course, with such an exorbitant offer the hammer or mallet quickly goes down. And the poor man, though a faithful worshipper, is made to feel that he is not serving God or helping the church, all because he is poor!
         Under such circumstances, the poor people are not happy being obsessed with inferiority complex. Granted that those articles have divine blessing, why should they be dispenses in such a way as to deprive the poor of them – the poor who are more often than not richer in faith?
         This in truth is far from being a Christian practice. There is a clear case in the Scriptures of a poor widow who gave a farthing and earned more praise and blessing than the rich when offerings were made in the days of Jesus. This was so, because, judged spiritually, the poor widow gave more than the rich. She gave ALL she had while the rich only gave insignificant portions of their abundance. – Mark 12:41-44; Luke 21:1-4.
         
         There are instances too where certain church groups on the occasion of harvest festival, sponsored and organized ball dances; and the proceeds went into the coffers of the churches. It is most disappointing and very bad indeed that a church organization should sponsor a ball dance and give occasion for immorality to be practiced. What some people do with married and unmarried women on such occasions are a common knowledge and they are a transgression of Christian principles. In such places too people drink and get drunk and there can be nothing in such things that could tend to give glory to God and Christ. Yet these things are done in the name of God so that the churches may get funds!
         But St. Paul said: “Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.” – 1st Corinthians 10:31.
         Profiteering
         No language can be too hard to be used in condemning the sale of articles at extraordinarily high prices under the auspices of a church organization. If individuals do what the churches are practicing they will definitely be guilty of profiteering and we do not see how the churches can be absolved from such a guilt. In fact, with a church which is identified with the name of God and which should be a shining example to the believers in the practice of righteousness, it is even worse.
         From the law of God concerning usury in the days of old, Christians can understand how to deal among themselves in a righteous way. The law prohibits the imposing of any interest on a loan, whether in money or in wheat or other commodities. As it is written: “Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother; usury of money, usury of victuals, usury of any thing that is lent upon usury.” (Deuteronomy 23:19; see also Exodus 22:25 and Leviticus 25:36, 37.) and in Proverbs 28:8, it is stated: “He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor.”
         There is no doubt that a gain of nine pounds and 17 shillings on a tuber of yam costing only three shillings is excessive and most unjust. Moderation is a Christian virtue. And St. Paul admonished: “Let your moderation be known unto all men.” – Philippians 4:5.
         Another detestable aspect of the whole show is that of the playing of games of chance for money. Such things as bagatelle, “lucky-dip”, roffle and so on, are done some as a part of harvest festival in order to swell the purse of the Church! No faithful, true worshipper of God takes part in gambling because it is known to be unscriptural. (Proverbs 28:20, 22; 20:21; 1st Timothy 6:6-12, 17-19) And so the doing of it under the auspices of a church must be condemned without reservation.
         
         The early disciples of Jesus Christ did not organize bazaars at any time to raise funds to carry on the work of God. The Jews who carried trade into the house of God in the days of Jesus Christ had an experience which should serve as a lesson to church groups that luxuriate in the exercise of buying and selling as a part of harvest thanksgiving.
         Reporting the incident, St. John stated: “And the Jews’ Passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem, and found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting: and when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers’ money, and overthrew the tables; and said unto them that sold doves, take these things hence; make not my Father’s house an house of merchandise” (John 2:13-17) It is sometimes said that it is because of what Christ did that certain people do not now make their bazaars inside their church buildings. But the questions is, did Christ command them to do so at all?
         Harvest Festival
         The feast of harvest, we agree, was one of the festivals God Almighty commanded the Jews through Moses to observe. It was also called the feast of weeks and it was connected with the agricultural season of the Jews. The law says: “Thou shall keep the feast of unleavened bread and the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours, which thou hast sown in the field” – Exodus 23:15-19; see also Deuteronomy 16:9-12.
         The law further states that the people should not appear empty-handed but that “every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of the LORD thy God which He hath given thee.” (Deuteronomy 16:16, 17) There was no provision that the produce from the farms should be auctioned at exorbitant prices as the churches are doing.
         The point which we must bring to light is the fact that there is no instruction that the harvest festival should be continued in the Christian Era. Jesus Christ did not observe it and his apostles never did either.
         
         To all true Christians what harvest means is clearly indicated in the parable of Jesus Christ concerning the tares and the wheat. As it is written: “Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, the Kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field: but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way. But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? From whence then hath it tares? He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.” – Matthew, 13:24-30.
         Jesus Christ did give the interpretation of the parable to his disciples. As it is written: “Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field. He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man; the field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one; the enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels. As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.” – Matthew, 13:36-40.
         Spiritual Harvest
         It is of great interest to Christians to know that we are now in the harvest age and God is already gathering His sheep, the children of the kingdom, into His fold through the preaching of the gospel. This work will continue until the end when God through Jesus Christ and his angels will take vengeance on the devil’s children, the tares. On this score, Jesus said: “The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; and shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.” – Verses 41-42.
         The fire is a symbol of the torment and anguish the wicked shall suffer at that time as a reward of their sins before they shall die and go to everlasting destruction. And St. Paul said: “But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile.” (Romans 2:8,9). It is not after death they would be cat into the symbolic fire but in their life-time because after death a man does not know anything neither can he feel pain. – Psalm, 146:3, 4; Ecclesiastes, 9:5, 10.
         But concerning the children of God who believe and obey the TRUTH and have been gathered into His Kingdom organization, Jesus said: “Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.” – Matthew, 13:43.
         It is the spiritual harvest – the gathering of God’s children in this age – that is of importance to Christians. People who have this understanding must endeavour to be diligent in the studies of the Scriptures so as to acquire the knowledge that will enable them to serve as fitting vessels in the Lord’s field service. Despite the deteriorating state of the world in spiritual and moral values, there are millions of people who are yearning for the truth of Jesus Christ. But those gifted with the power of the gospel in the true sense of it are very scarce indeed.
         This, as a matter of fact, is no surprise since it goes to fulfil the words of our Lord and Saviour: “The harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that He would send forth labourers into His harvest.” – Luke 10:2.
         In the light of the foregoing, it will be wrong for Christians to continue to celebrate harvest as an occasion for bringing to church services money and other products, and for engaging in profiteering or in unjust commercialism in the name of God. The harvest that Christians should concern themselves with is not that of material things but the one that has to do with the salivation of the righteous in this last days of the present evil world that is now racing at a terrific speed to its destruction.`,

         content:`THE quality of the faith of anyone who professes Christianity does not depend on his oral acceptance of Jesus Christ but on the soundness and purity of the doctrines he believes. If the doctrines are pure or true in the sense that they are established in the Holy Scriptures, then the faith is also genuine and well founded; but if on the contrary the doctrines are false, the obvious fact is that the faith, no matter how elegant or gigantic its outward structure, is as well spurious. And Jesus warned, “beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees”!

         Spiritual Malnutrition
         As lack of good food is capable of impairing bodily health and causing death, so too doctrines that are devoid of truth are harmful to the spiritual health of all people and can send them to destruction. Thus spiritual malnutrition is more dangerous than the physical one.
         The fact remains unfortunately, that many still suffer from spiritual malnutrition. They have been so tied to the apron-strings of false apostles and prophets, hypocritical ministers and visionists or dreamers that they can swallow without question any dogma no matter how unreasonable and unscriptural it may be. Such are the people who are fed with stones, (lies) instead of bread (truth).
         Some people think that once they express their belief in God, attend church services and pay dues in their church organizations they will be saved. They do not care whether the doctrines of those organizations are in total harmony with the Scriptures or not. This indifference on the part of certain people in regard to doctrines has made false prophets and teachers to gain undue advantage of them. But except such ones go out of the grip of blind leaders to follow the light of Jesus Christ, the end will be gloomy. God said: “A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land; the prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love to have it so: and what will ye do in the end thereof?” – Jeremiah 5: 30, 31.
         
         Leaven of Pharisees
         Jesus Christ does not want his followers to believe false doctrines because he knows that they cannot lead to salvation. In the course of his ministry on earth, he warned his disciples against the teachings of the Pharisees and Sadducees. He said: “Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.”
         Not understanding what the Master meant his disciples thought he was talking of ordinary bread. After Christ had advanced a few points more, “then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees”.-Matthew, 16: 6-12.
         The apostle John stated: “Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.” 1st John 4: 1
         
         And St. Paul said: “Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.” (1st Thessalonians 5: 21) But how many pay heed to these admonitions of the apostles? How many people take time to examine doctrines before they believe? Do some not just stick to certain church organizations because of unspiritual reasons such as being born into that particular church group or for its being one of the oldest orthodox churches or for having married in that church or for attending the college or university founded by that church? To remain in a church, which teaches false doctrines, for these unscriptural reasons is wrong and disastrous in the end -Proverbs 16: 25.
         However, we thank God that through the publications of God’s Kingdom Society (GKS) and some other christian groups, many people are now getting out from the shackles of dogmatism and ignorance and are seeing the light of Jesus to appreciate the importance of doctrines. They no longer want to be led by the nose. It was Christ who said: “And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.”-John 8: 32.
         Owing to lack of spiritual knowledge and because of simplicity many people have been deceived with the result that they base their faith on errors or false teachings. There is need to be critical of doctrines, not with the aim to find fault but to ascertain the truth of our beliefs. Said St. Paul: “That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; but speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ.” – Ephesians 4: 14, 15; Hebrews 13: 9.
         
         Many institutions of learning have become places where children are fed with lies about God and His purposes of creation. Some of those who are employed to teach religious knowledge in the colleges do not know God, they themselves being sceptics or nominal Christians. It is most unfortunate that certain people who do not believe in the Bible are made to be religious teacher: merely because of paper qualifications. In- stead of imparting divine knowledge to their students they preach their own imaginations and doctrines of devils and consequently the children become godless and come out of schools as atheists or agnostics.
         In certain public examinations the answers to some of the questions which have been given credence in the subject of religion and for which some obtained credit are a farrago of untruth. Of course, it is not from secular, academic authorities people should expect to gain the knowledge of God’s revelation that will make them to be saved; it is from ministers of religion who preach the truth of God without corruption as recorded in the Bible. – Proverbs 12: 17; 14: 25; Jeremiah 3: 15.
         
         Invented Dogmas
         Also in many church organizations the ministers, priest and catechists teach a lot of things for which they have no scriptural authority. They always stick to the vain traditions of men and invented dogmas of their predecessors, though some of such teachings are against their own conscience.
         Let us examine some few points of doctrine that are being taught today:
         
         For instance, many have been taught to believe that God’s Kingdom is only in heaven which they say is the home of all the righteous. Yet they pray for God’s Kingdom to come to the earth. And Jesus Christ said: “Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.” (Matthew, 5: 5) And if all the good are in heaven and the wicked are in hell-fire as they believe, why did Jesus Christ say that in the day of resurrection all the dead, both good and bad would come from the graves? He did not teach that the righteous would descend from heaven or that the wicked would come out of fire but that all of them would rise from the GRAVES!- John 5: 28, 29; see also Acts 24: 15.
         Some say that the soul can never die. But this view is the very opposite of the truth of the Scriptures. St. Peter said that unbelieving souls shall be destroyed. (Acts 3: 23) If “the soul can never die” as some churches are teaching why did St Peter make such statement? Look up also Psalm, 89: 48 (Psalm, 88: 49-Douay); Ezek. 18:4,20; Matthew, 10:28 and Revelation 16:3.
         It is also held as an article of faith in certain circles that Mary is the mediatrix between God and men but this has no foundation in the Scriptures, rather the Bible states positively that there is “ONE MEDIATOR between God and men, the man Christ Jesus” (1st Timothy 2: 5), NOT Mary.
         It is also believed and taught that Mary was carried body and soul by angels to heaven. This is a blatant lie. We challenge anyone to cite a single proof from the Scriptures, which all churches agree is the AUTHORITY, to substantiate this view. The human corruptible body CANNOT go to, or dwell in heaven. It is written clearly in the Scriptures that “flesh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God” in heaven. (1st Corinthians 15: 50) Jesus himself went there, NOT with human body, but with the spiritual body by which God raised him from the dead.-l Pet. 3: 18-20; Acts 1: 1-9; 1st Corinthians 15: 40, 44, 49-50.
         There are certain religious organizations that allow women to preach from house to house or to mount the pulpits to preach sermons in the churches. But St. Paul says, “Let your women KEEP SILENCE in the churches: for it is NOT PERMITTED UNTO THEM TO SPEAK.” (1st Corinthians 14: 34,35) And he further stated: “BUT I SUFFER NOT A WOMAN TO TEACH, nor to usurp authority over the man.” 1st Timothy 2: 11-14.
         We have brought the foregoing few points to light to show how many errors have been accepted by people knowingly or unknowingly, and to stress the need for vigilance.
         Any doctrine that is not in conformity with the holy Scriptures is counterfeit and must be discarded. If anybody tells you to accept a dogma whose authority is derived from a source outside the Holy Bible, never must you give in-even if he calls himself the most holy angel. Here is St. Paul’s stern I warning: “But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. As we have said before, so say I now again, if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.”-Galatians 1: 8,9; see also Isaiah 8: 20.
         
         Furthermore, St. Paul in his first letter to Timothy stated: “If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness; he is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings, perverse disputings as of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself.” – 1st Timothy 6: 3-5.
         Doctrine of Christ The importance of doctrines cannot be over-stated. True doctrines are from God. Jesus Christ said: “My doctrine is not mine, but His that sent me. If any man will do His will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.” (John 7: 16, 17) These true doctrines cannot be obtained from anywhere other than from the Holy Bible.
         
         And St. Paul stated emphatically: “All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.” – 2nd Timothy 3: 16,17.
         Anyone who wanders from the teachings of Jesus Christ as revealed in the Scriptures will lose the favour of God and the grace of life. It is worthwhile to warn people therefore not to take things for granted nor do anything to support false religious ministers and to promote the cause of falsehood and unrighteousness. John the apostle wrote: “Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God.”
         
         “He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son. If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed: for he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.” – 2nd John 9-11.
         True Christians of today must follow the example of Jesus Christ and see to it that his doctrines are jealously guarded against corruption. St. Paul said: “For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.” (2nd Corinthians 2: 17) And knowing the importance of doctrines he (Paul) charged Timothy: “If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained. But refuse profane and old wives’ fables, and exercise thyself rather unto godliness. Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.” – 1st Timothy 4: 6-7,16.
         The apostle also counselled Titus to be a pattern of good works, and added, “In doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity, sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.” -Read Titus 2: 1,7-8.
         The facts are quite clear. Let no one expose himself to the poison of false doctrines and so suffer spiritual malnutrition. Rather let everyone ensure that he receives but the untarnished truth of the saving gospel of Jesus Christ as clearly recorded in the Bible for his spiritual well-being and salvation.`,

      {key:8,
         content:`WITHOUT the fear of God no one successfully practise righteousness. It is not the morbid fear or the sort of mental distress a person experiences when he is in a state of alarm or in danger. But it is the fear of reverence for God Almighty which springs from a knowledge of His holiness and greatness, and which makes one keep His commandments for one’s own blessing.

         Some people think that the fear of God is a mater of an outward appearance or vain show of piety. When they see a person who appears to be quiet, bashful and soft in speech they conclude that he is of good character and God fearing. But experience has shown that certain men who in the open seem to be gentle and shy are in actual fact very mischievous. In secret they do iniquitous acts – they defile young spinsters and even ungodly house wives; they conspire and plot against people. So too some “quiet” women are like a snake under the green grass and are very unfaithful, wicked and dangerous.
         There are also certain people who appear to be religious. Whenever the name of God or Jesus Christ is mentioned they show signs of respect. When they enter a religious congregation to worship they put on a garb of “holiness”: they walk on the tips of their toes and pace like a chameleon to their seats; they say prayers with an air of devotion and sing with “angelic” voices. But if you look beyond their sanctimonious attitude, you find traits of a devil. Their hearts are filled with malice, envy and so on, and in their dealings with their fellow men they are inhuman. It will be wrong to think or say that such people are God-fearing. They are not but are hypocrites. – Matthew 15:7-9
         In Proverbs 8:13, It is written: “The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the forward mouth” And in Proverbs 16:6, King Solomon stated; “By the fear of the LORD men depart from evil.”
         We can understand from the texts just cited that the fear of God makes one refrain from evil, and that in essence means the keeping or doing of the commandments of God. That was why after the Israelites had seen certain wondrous things done by God in those days, Moses told them: “Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that His fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not.” (Exodus 20:20) In this text two kinds of fear are shown. The first in the clause fear not, is that of fright or worry of a person in a state of alarm. So Moses counseled them not to be alarmed or frightened. But the second in the emphasized portion is the fear of God which would make them not to sin.
         Furthermore, Moses exhorted the Israelites, saying: “That thou mightest fear the LORD thy God, to keep all His statutes and His commandments, which I command thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son’s son, all the days of thy life; and that thy days may be prolonged.” – Deuteronomy. 6:2.
         The importance of the fear of God, therefore, cannot be overstated. It makes God’s spiritual and material blessings come to one. It was Job who quoted God as saying: “Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.” (Job 28:28) And the Psalmist said: “The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do His commandments: His praise endureth for ever.” – Psalm 111:10; see also Proverbs 1:7.
         
         Instances
         In the Holy Bible there are instances of men and women who feared God and who were blessed. The instance of Joseph who maintained his integrity when he was enticed by the wife of his master, Potiphar, in Egypt, is a case in point. Because he feared God he refused to deal sexually with his master’s wife as she wanted him to do, and he said to the foolish woman: “How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?” (Read Genesis 39:7-10) But is it not true that some people today – especially among the sophisticated, the so called civilized ones – relish in committing adultery? However, we can understand that such people have not the fear of God; and except they repent to satisfy God they cannot escape the divine retribution of their wickedness.
         There is also the case of the Hebrew midwives, Shiphrah and Puah, in Egypt. They were women who feared God. When Pharaoh, the wicked king of Egypt, noticed that the Israelites were fruitful, and increased abundantly, till the land was full of them, he was stirred by envy and became uneasy. He feared that the children of Israel might become stronger than they and affiliate with their enemies to war against them. Apart from a number of oppressive measures the Egyptians took against the Jews, Pharaoh ordered the two midwives that whenever a Jewish woman put to bed, the child if a male should be killed at once but if it be a female it should be spared.
         It is interesting to note that the midwives, because they were God fearing, defied the order of the king. As it is written: “But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men, children alive; Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty. And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that He made them houses.” (Exodus 1:15-21) and the Moffatt Translation of the Bible renders the last part of the text thus: “God prospered the midwives; since the midwives had reverenced God, He made them mothers of families.”
         We cannot fail to draw the attention of present-day Christians, who are privileged to be in the humanitarian professions of nursing and midwifery, to this instance of godly fear and human touch shown by the Hebrew midwives. The lesson all doctors, nurses, midwives as well as all other persons in other walks of life should learn from it is that it pays to fear God. But whoever acts otherwise will only but bring upon himself in the end God’s wrath and vengeance. However long it may be, God will act some day unexpectedly.
         Elisabeth, the wife of Zacharias the priests, was also a God-fearing woman. She, as well as her husband, kept the Lord’s commandments without blame and they were both righteous in the sight of God. Though Elisabeth was barren she did not part from her husband as some godless women would do neither did she turn to other gods. She remained faithful to God and to her husband till old age. In the long run, God comforted and blessed her with a child, and thus became the distinguished mother of John the Baptist – a great prophet who had the honour of being the forerunner of Christ Jesus. – Luke 1:5-14, 24-25, 57-58.
         
         Goodness
         It pays much, we reiterate, to fear God. King David said that the goodness of God which He has prepared for those who fear Him is great, and that He cares for them and delivers them from their troubles. (Psalm 31:19, 33:18, 19; 34:7) He declared: “Blessed is the man that feareth the LORD, that delighteth greatly in His commandments. His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the upright shall be blessed. Wealth and riches shall be in his house: and his righteousness endureth for ever.” – Psalm 112:1-3; see also Psalm 145:19; 147:11; Proverbs 14:26, 27; Ecclesiastes. 8:12, etc.
         Moreover, King Solomon said: “The fear of the LORD prolongeth days: but the years of the wicked shall be shortened.” (Proverbs 10:27) Again, he stated: “The fear of the LORD tendeth to life: and he that hath it shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil.” – Proverbs 19:23.
         
         It is required of those who are in authority that they should rule in the fear of God. They should not oppress people or exploit their ignorance and weakness to benefit themselves. It is righteousness that would make the Most High to guide, protect and bless them (the rulers). Hence David, the king and prophet, declared: The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God. (2 Samuel 23:3) Moreover, it is written: “When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn. The righteous considereth the cause of the poor: but the wicked regardeth not to know it.” – Proverbs 29:2, 7.
         At this juncture, it is worthwhile to recall what happened among the Jews after their return from Babylonish captivity as recorded in Nehemiah chapter five. When there was scarcity of food, the nobles and rulers took undue advantage of their positions to enrich themselves at the expense of the masses. Usury became the order of the day. They exacted of the common people money, corn and so on, to the extent that people mortgaged their lands, vineyards and houses in order to get daily bread. There was a general outcry of the people.
         But when Nehemiah was appointed governor he distinguished himself as a man of honour, integrity and prudence because he feared God. The role he played to restore order for the good of the nation was a mark of true greatness and nobility for which in ecclesiastical history he is venerated. Nehemiah rebuked the nobles and rulers, and said: “Ye exact usury, every one of his brother, It is not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen?” (Verses 6-9) He made them restore to the people their lands, vineyards and houses, and parts of the money, corn, wine and oil that were exacted from them. – Verses 10-13.
         Nehemiah himself stated that since the time he was appointed governor, he and his brothers never ate of the governor’s provisions. And he added: “But the former governors that had been before me were chargeable unto the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, beside forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the FEAR OF GOD.” – Verses 14, 15.
         We can see from the foregoing what effect the fear of God can have on the character of a person.
         
         An End
         The various incidents of atrocities, corruption, immorality and so forth, which are happening in all parts of the world, are clear indication that, despite man’s advance in science, technology and social life, the world is spiritually degenerating – all because the majority of people do not fear God.
         Here in Nigeria we have our experiences. In spite of the awareness of our people about the sins and ills that culminated in the current tragedy of this nation, many are not yet sober neither have they learnt to fear God. Some still continue in perpetrating wicked acts such as murder, stealing, bribery, oppression, nepotism, fraud, adultery, fornication, lying and such like. Those who take pleasure in violence, or any type of evil, must be told this home truth of the Scriptures that iniquity has an end, and the end is in sight.
         We are now living in an age when God would make the wicked taste the fruit of their doings. The Bible says: “They that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.” (Job 4:8) And King Solomon declared: “The wicked worketh a deceitful work: but to him that soweth righteousness shall be a sure reward. As righteouness tendeth to life: so he that pursueth evil pursueth it to his own death. Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished: but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.” – Proverbs 11:18-19, 21.
         
         Wholesome Fear
         A Christian will not be worth his name if he does not fear God. We agree that gentleness is a Christian virtue but the fact is that any virtuous act which is not based on the fear of God is spiritually unprofitable. St. Paul admonished that Christians should purify themselves and live in the wholesome fear of God. Said he: “Dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.” – 2 Corinthians 7:1.
         The apostle also exhorted Christians to submit themselves one to another in the fear of God. (Ephesians 5:21) He further said: “Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear.” – Hebrews 12:28.
         What is more, St. Peter in his epistle stated: “Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.” – 1 Peter 2:17.
         It is good and profitable that men everywhere should fear God and do what is right. And King Solomon said: “Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man. For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.” – Ecclesiastes 12:13, 14.`,

         content:`THOUGH wine bas its social usefulness of cheering up the heart of man, it bites like a snake and has demoralizing effects on those who take it too much. Drunkenness is said to be voluntary madness. And the fact that no drunkard has a place in God’s glorious, everlasting Kingdom clearly explains the dangers to which a person who indulges in excessive drinking is exposed.
         According to The American Peoples Encyclopedia, “Drunkenness is legally the lack of mental coherence and self-control which is produced in a person by drinking intoxicating liquors to excess. Although a single act of intoxication is properly described as drunkenness, a drunkard or inebriate is usually one who habitually consumes an excess of intoxicating liquors.”
         In the first place, we wish to dismiss the argument of some people that it is a sin for a Christian to drink. There is no law in the Holy Bible that prohibits drinking but it becomes a sin when it is done in excess. The Psalmist speaking about the providence of God towards mankind, declared among other things: “He (God) causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth; and wine tbat maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man’s heart.” (Psalm, 104: 14, 15) And King S,lomnn also stated that “wine maketh merry”. – Ecclesiastes 10: 19.
         We can as well recall that the first miracle of Jesus Christ was his turning of water into wine at a marriage feast in Cana of Galilee. He commanded that the governor of the feast st,nuld be served with the wine. (John 2: 1-11) If it were a sin to drink wine Christ would not have produced it miraculously fol’ anyone to take.
         What is more, because of the medicinal properties in wine, St. Paul advised Timothy to take a little of it. Said he: “Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach’s sake and thine often infirmities.” -1st Timothy 5: 23.
         Some drunkards often encourage themselves by this advice of St Paul in their self-indulgence. Such people are only fooling themselves. St. Paul did not tell Timothy to take much wine. Rather, he told him to take little, and even condemned excessive drinking. He admonished: “Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the wilt of the Lord is. And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit.”- Ephesians 5: 17, 18.
         
         Detestable Indulgence
         Drunkeenes is fraught with evils. This is well known to men, yet many are not wise enough so as not to become its victims. Certain people who were once known for their brilliance and who would have attained greatness in their careers have been brought to ruin by drinks. Those whose progress in life have been impeded by drunkenness within living memory are very many. Among young men and women It has also been one of the causes of untimely deaths. Like the canker-worm it has eaten deep into the fabric of the social life of this country as in many other parts of the world.
         To drink excessively is now a common practice associated with some social pride among the worldlings. Some pot-bellied “good m;.xers” actually boast of their capacity to empty six bottles of beer or more at a sitting. In the hotels and pubs and at social gatherings this class of people are found sur- feiting themselves on alcoholic drinks. The upshot of this detestable indulgence is that some become physIcally weak, dizzy and stupid.
         Doctors have proved that alcohol is harmful to the human body. And drunkenness is produced by an overdose of alcohol that is taken and it thus results in loss of memory, deterioration of character, carelessness in personal appearance, hoarse voice and so forth. Dr. A. C. Selmon, in his work, The New Health and Longevity, stated: “Alcohol is a powerful poison which in man’s body is destructive to both mental and physical processes. The central nervous system is the first to feel its effects. Long beflJre the drinker begins to stagger and feel uncertain on his feet, his brain processes are slowed down. Memory and mental concentration are impaired…Alcohol impairs judgment and reduces mental restraint and self-control. Many criminals drink liquor before doing their wicked deeds. It dulls their sense of right and wrong. – Many youths are led into sin while under the influence of alcohol. Those who wish to have full control over their behaviour should surel}! abstain from the use of all intoxicating beverages. Alcohol may do serious damage to the stomach, liver, blood- vessels, kidneys and nervous system. It lowers the resistance of the body to disease, especially those diseases affecting the lungs such as pneumonia and tuberculosis.”-Pages 91-92.
         
         Disadvantages
         A man who is addicted to drinks gives more consideration to the “pleasure” he gets in that form of self-indulgence than to the economic affairs of his family. Some people spend large sums of money on drinks every month. And when the income of an addict is not enough to meet his drinking demands, he plunges into debts. This may be the beginning of the sorrows of a whole family. God’s inspired word through Solomon the wise man is: “Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the way. Be not among wine-bibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh: for the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags.” – Proverbs 23: 19-21.
         Drunkenness, for its spiritual, economic and social disadvatages, has led te the breaking of marriages where the wives could no longer endure the daily misconducts and acts of irresponsibility of their husbands, and the -hardship consequent upon their drinking habits.
         Concerning alcoholic drinks, the Modern Medical Counselor has this to say: “Drinking alcoholic liquor is another dangerous habit. Some persons come to be so completely under its power that they will deprive themselves and their families of necessary food, clothing, and shelter in order to buy liquor. They will even steal or rob to get it. What does it do to the body? It benumbs the brain and makes one do and say foolish things. In cold places it makes one feel warm, so that the danger of freezing to death is greatly increased. It makes one feel strong when he is weak, so he tries to do things tbat are too hard to do. It impairs his judgment and makes him insensible to danger, so he takes needless risks and caures accidents to himself and to others.”
         Drunkenness is the cause of certain motor accidents. How many people have died before their time under such circumstances no one can tell. An American neurologist once said, “Just a drink or two and the safe driver is turned into a reckless traffic menace!” We can rightly imagine the fate of 20 or more passengers in a motor vehicle that is driven by a man who is completely under the control of alcohol. According to Dr. Selmon, when a person takes alcohol, activities involving speed and accuracy are carried on with reduced efficiency. He added: “Even a small amount of alcohol lowers reo action time, that is, the ability of muscles and nerves to react quickly. This is the chief reason why it is so dangerous for drivers of motor vehicles or aeroplanes to indulge even in a small amount of alcoholic liquor. Even one bottle of beer impairs the sense of distance, slows reactions, and lessens jucgment. When large amounts are taken, drivers become reckless, because although alcohol reduces efliciency it gives the individual confidence and he feels that be is very alert mentally and physically, well able to accomplish his task.”-The New Health and Longevity, Page 91.
         
         Dr. Leonard Goldberg of Sweden’s Caroline Institute was reported to have carried out experiment in order to know the effects on driving of light drinking – just a few beers or whiskies. In the long run, he concluded that “even a slight amount of alcohol caused a deterioration of between 25 and 30 per cent in the driving performance of expert drivers”. This was contained in an article on “What Two Drinks Will Do to Your Driving” by Don Wharton in the Readers’ Digest of December 1964.
         He showed clearly that alcohol slows down reactions, and creates false confidence. He quoted New Zealand’s Road Code: “A little alcohol has the double effect of making him drive worse and believe he is driving better.” He stated that alcohol affects vision. impairs concentration and dulls judgment; and that it “makes drivers talk more and causes their attention to be more easily diverted”. He then drew his readers’ attention to the slogan: “If you drive, don’t drink. If you drink, don’t drive”.
         
         Madness
         When a person is drunk he is unable to distinguish right from wrong because the influence of alcohol has overshadowed him and seized his power of reasoning. He talks and acts foolishly without shame. The condition in which some people return home from social gatherings when they are drunk is often shameful and annoying. Some have to become heavy loads for others to carry home with shirts and coats rumpled and trousers soaked with urine. Some vomit on their beds and do lots of thing. to embarrass their relatives. wives, children and friends. And when they become sober they often find themselves looking so much dejected and worn out. Yea, King Solomon did say: “Wine is a mocker. strong drink is raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.” – Proverbs 20 : I
         There was a gentleman who on his return home from a party, because he was drunk, administered a nasty knock on the head of his daughter who ran to embrace him, and spat or. the face of his wife who showed up in love to welcome her darling. It is in this respect drunkenness is voluntary madness. In fact, sometimes a person who is drunk misbehaves worse than a mad man. If a mad person comes across a pit on his way he can safely pass by its side but a drunkard in his usual reckless abandon may fall into it and get himself seriously wounded. Medical authorities are unanimous on the point that alcoholism does damage to its victims and that the symptoms of “acute alcoholism amount to mental derangement”. Although a victim may not like to admit this, it is obvious that he is temporarily not in his right mind. Such a person who is alcoholic can be cured only by the help of God and through prayer.
         Here is an authoritative opinion from the Modern Medical Counselor:
         
         “Chronic alcoholism lowers ethical, social, and moral standards and often permanently weakens the intellectual powers. Alcoholic addicts become untruthful, quarrelsome, and often unreasonably suspicious of infidelity in their marital partners. They fairly often have attacks of persistent hallucinations. They “hear voices” accusing them of sexual perversions or threatening to kill them. They may apply to the police for relief from fancied persecutions.”
         The book adds: “Successful treatment of alcoholism is difficult. The patient’s will may become so weakened that even though he is deprived of alcohol for several weeks he cannot keep himself from going back to it when freed from restraint; and, in spite of the fact that he thinks he wants to be free from the habit and has sought treatment on his own initiative, he will lie and use deceit without limit to obtain access to alcohol at the very time when he is under treatment… Di’fine aiti obtained through prayer has conquered alcoholism in many cases.”-Page 517. (Emphasis ours)
         And turning to the Scriptures there is abundance of proofs in regard to the be effects of alcohol. King Solomon asked: “Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes?” (Proverbs 23: 29) He himself answered: “They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine.”-Verse 30.
         The king then warned: “1ook not thou upon the wine when it is red. when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright. At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder. Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter perverse things. Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea. or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast. They have stricken me, sha1t thou say. and I was not sick: the v have beaten me. Pond I felt it not: when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again.” – Proverbs 23: 31-35.
         When a person is drunk he is exposed to various dangers. Any valuable thing or money in his posaession can easily be stolen from him. It is possible for his enemies to pounce on him and do him harm or even kill him without the least resistance. In the case of a woman, evil men’may take undue advantage of her being under intoxication and get her raped. Or she may be improperly dressed as to expose her nakedness in public. What a shame! This can be so because she is not responsible or in her right mind. The Bible states: “Whoredom (illicit sexual act) and wine and new wine take away the heart.” -Hosea 4: 11.
         The evil of drunkenness was seen in Lot who had carnal knowledge of his two foolish daughters when they made him drunk. (Genesis 19: 30-38 ) Notwithstanding the circumstances that pushed Lot’s daughters into that action, they were unjustified. The law of God is against whoever makes his neighbour drunk so as to see his or her nakedness. As it is written: “Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy bottle to him, and makest him drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness!”- Habakkuk 2: 15.
         
         Sometimes at midnight and after, we find men and women from pubs especially in the big cities roaming aimlessly and staggering along the streets under the control of alcohol. There are some of them who pass the nights in smelly gutters and look like demented creatures. Yet this is what some people call “high life”!
         “Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish,” said King Solomon, “and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts. Let him! drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.” (Prov, 31: 6, 7) But the point is that the poverty and misery .are not removed but forgotten only for a while. And in Isaiah 5: 11,22-23, it is written: “Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; that continue until night, till wine inflame them! Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink: which justify the wicked for reward. and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!”
         Finally, we must emphasise once again the fact that drunkenness is one of the evils that can make a person not to enter God’s Kingdom of eternal glory, peace and happiness. (Galatians 5: 19-21) And St, Paul wrote: “Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?..neither fornicators, nor idolaters NOR DRUNKARDS, shall inherit the kingdom of God,”-1st Corinthians 6: 9. 10.
         Abstinence from excessive drinking is one of the characteristics of a truly converted Christian, His old playmates may jeer at him for not being in their company yet he must maintain his integrity, knowing that it is those who speak evil of him that will be judged by Christ Jesus. On this score. St. Peter stated: “For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, EXCESS OF WINE, REVELLINGS, BANQUETINGS, and abominable idolatries: wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you: who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.” – 1st Peter 4: 3-5.
         The evils of drunkenness as clearly shown in this Sermon cannot be overstated. It is wise to abstain from alcoholic drinks altogether and whoever drinks in moderation is not a sinner. But we should keep in mind always this apostolic exhortation: “The night is far spent, the day is at hand; let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light. Let us walk honestly as in the day; NOT IN RIOTING AND DRUNKENNESS, NOT IN CHAMBERING AND WANTONNESS, NOT IN STRIFE AND ENVYING. But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof,” -Romans 13: 12-14.`,

         content:`IN sacred history we find occasions when the Almighty God took measures to punish men for their sins while He placed under His refuge His faithful worshippers. Any of such doings was an act of God. However, what may appear in the eyes of many people in the world to be an act of God may not in reality be so. It requires divine knowledge and spiritual understanding to know what truly is an act of God.

         According to JACK’S REFERENCE BOOK, the phrase “Act of God” is used by lawyers to indicate “a direct, violent, sudden, and irresistible act of nature, which could not, by any reasonable care, have been foreseen or resisted”. This is said to be “one of the few defences open to a common carrier who fails to safely deliver goods; he is always freed from liability if he can show that an act of God proved the sole, direct and irresistible cause of the loss”.
         The American Peoples Encyclopedia states: “ACT OF GOD, as a legal expression, signifies any occurrence not caused by human negligence, or intervention; such as storms, lighting tempests, the consequence of which no party under any circumstances (independently of special contract) is bound to make good to another. The chief applications of the term are in insurance, where Act of god is an exception to the insurer’s liability; and in the law of contract, where it often excuses from performance.” (Vol. 1, page 129).
         From the interpretation given the phrase act of God as a legal expression we can rightly judge that the ordinary understanding of the makers of the law could not be much different from what many people think up till today as regards an act of God. We agree as legally defined that unforeseen, sudden and violent occurrences caused by spiritual forces cannot be humanly resisted. But is it correct to say that ALL such occurrences are from God? Considered from a religious or scriptural standpoint, certain occurrences such as those under discussion, which have been passed by English law as acts of God, do not really proceed from God Almighty.
         
         Misfortune
         Now, when a calamity or misfortune befalls some people they often say that it is an act of God.
         As a matter of fact the history of the human race is filled with sad events of this nature. We can recall the incident of the earthquake which in 1960, shattered the Moroccan port of Agadir in which 12,000 were reported killed! There were instances in which storms caused rivers to rise and canoes or boats were capsized resulting in the loss of lives and property. Only last week the Sunday Post (Sept. 7, 1969) carried the news that “at least 38 people have died as the tail end of hurricane Francelia brought torrential rain and floods to low-lying areas of Southern Mexico. More than 50,000 people were left homeless as rivers burst their banks.” A certain woman who lost her daughter in a canoe disaster sometime ago, said while wailing that she did not know why God always afflicted her. She believed that it was God that caused the trouble. In fact, many people always think that God is responsible for their sufferings, poverty and misfortunes. This attitude of men is borne out of ignorance concerning the purpose and ways of God.
         It is our aim in this Sermon to make people of goodwill understand what actually, according to the Bible, is an act of God so that they may disabuse their minds of whatever bias they might have developed against God consequent upon any past bitter experience.
         
         Acts of Satan
         The Holy Bible clearly shows that Satan the devil is responsible for many things such as those mentioned earlier in this treatise. But he makes people believe that God is the cause of their ills and thereby influences them to reproach their Maker. There are people who because of what they have suffered in life have developed hate for God and refrained from worshiping Him. The devil is always pleased with such people for having deceived them to achieve his objective – even if only for a while.
         We have a great lesson to learn from what happened to Job in his days at the instance of the devil. Job was a man who was perfect and upright in heart and one who feared God and eschewed evil. The devil boasted before God that but for His protection over Job, he (Satan) could make him (Job) to curse God to His face. But God said to Satan: “Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand.” – Read Job 1:1-12.
         
         It is recorded that Satan went forth from the presence of God and persecuted Job. He caused the loss of Job’s oxen, asses, sheep, camels and even servants with such a stroke as was capable of breaking the heart of any man. Moreover at that time of those heart-rending incidents, one of Job’s servants brought to him the most tragic news saying, “Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house: and, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.” – Job. 1:18, 19.
         But did Job blame God for his troubles as some so-called Christians do today? He never did. Rather he worshipped God and said: “Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.” And it is written: “In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.” – Read Job 1:20-22.
         The faith and understanding shown by Job was exemplary. When he said that God gave and He had taken away, he did not mean that it was God who killed his cattle, servants and children but that God allowed the tribulations to come to him hence the devil had his way.
         
         Yes, God allows such things in order to test the faith of His worshippers. And where thy prove steadfast and faithful He showers blessing upon them. Job had this understanding; that was why he did not charge God foolishly but blessed Him and maintained his integrity till the end. “So the Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning.” – Job 42:12-17; see also James 5:10, 11.
         However, the point we are making is that those troubles of Job were caused by the devil and they were therefore acts of Satan. But today similar things that happen to people are termed, ignorantly of course, acts of God.
         The devil has power to cause storms or violent winds and other things purposely to do havoc as in the case of Job’s children whom he killed with a storm. He did similar things in the days of Christ on earth but Jesus showed his superiority over him by commanding his storm to calmness. As it is written: “NOW it came to pass on a certain day, that he (Jesus) went into a ship with his disciple: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake. And they launched forth. But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled with water, and were in jeopardy. And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm. And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! For he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him.” – Luke 8:22-25.
         
         Finger of God
         It has been made plain enough that the incidents which some people describe as acts of God are in truth acts of Satan. But the question that still remains is, what is an act of God, and how can it be known?
         In the first place, we must point out that God does not act without first giving warning to the people. And when He acts He does not punish indiscriminately by getting the just and innocent ones involved. He warned the Jews saying: “The innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.” – Exodus 23:7; see also Proverbs 17:26.
         
         In the genesis of the human race when the population of the earth was growing dense, God found that wickedness had become the order of the day. Every imagination of the thoughts of the hearts of men was evil continually, and so the Great Creator decided to put an end to their iniquities by destroying them. Nevertheless, Noah, whom God found righteous, was sent to warn the inhabitants of the earth against the consequences of their sins and the impending destruction.
         And because the people paid no heed to the voice of God represented in Noah’s preaching but continued in the pleasures of sin, God caused the historic Deluge to destroy the world. But He saved Noah and his family of seven by means of the ark which He provided. The full account of this ancient event is recorded in Genesis chapters six to eight. And St. Peter stated that God “spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eight person, a preacher of righteousness, bring in the flood upon the world of the ungodly”. (2 Peter. 2:5) This was an act of God pure and simple.
         
         Another example is the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah in which Lot, who was a just man, with his daughters was delivered by God. – Genesis 19:1-30; 2 Peter 2:6-8.
         Furthermore, mention can be made of the plagues with which the Egyptians were punished in the days of Moses the prophet, as acts of God. Those wonders were so distinctive as of divine force that the magicians of Egypt were compelled to confess to pharaoh: “This is the finger of God.” (Exodus 8:16-19). And when the Israelites on their way to Canaan were being pursued by the Egyptians with a sinister motive, God destroyed them (Egyptians) in the Red Sea. Then the children of Israel under the leadership of Moses sang saying, “I will sing unto the Lord, for He hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath He thrown into the sea.” – Exodus 14:5-31; 15:1-13. This again is an act of God.
         Concerning those happenings, Moses later told the Jews: “..For I speak not with your children which have not known, and which have not seen the chastisement of the Lord your God, His greatness, His mighty hand, and His stretched out arm, and His miracles, and HIS ACTS, which He did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land. But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the Lord which He did.” – Deuteronomy 11:1-3, 7.
         
         Strange Act
         The prophecies of the Bible point to this our age, the last days, as a time when the most terrible of the acts of God will take place for the destruction of Satan and all wickedness. It is shown that it will be preceded by what is described as the “strange work”, which is the preaching of the gospel for the exposition of all works of error and darkness, and for the showing of the light of Christ to guide the sheep of God to salvation. This work of vital importance is now in progress. Isaiah’s prophecy says: “For the Lord shall rise up as in mount Perazim, He shall be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that He may do His work, His strange work; and bring to pass His act, His strange act.” – Isaiah 28:21.
         The strange act is not international wars but the great tribulation and battle of the great day of God Almighty, the like of which has not been seen or known in ALL world history. Concerning it, Jesus said: “For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.” (Matthew 24:21) And in Jeremiah it is written: “And the slain of the LORD shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground.” – Jeremiah 25:33.
         On the strength of the explanation we have made in this Sermon from the Bible point of view, it will be wrong to regard every operation by forces beyond human control as an act of God knowing that there are also evil forces under the command of Satan. The incidents of storms, hurricane,s typhoons, lightenings, floods and so on, in which people, good and bad, die in different parts of the world are the works of the devil who knows that he now has but a short time to live.
         
         Let no one therefore blame the cause of his ills upon God for He is not responsible for our temptations. James the apostle stated: “Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth He any man.” – James 1:13.
         However, be it known to everyone that the day of the Lord’s strange act, which is going to be the greatest catastrophe of all time, is drawing near. it is those who serve God faithfully and in truth that will be fully protected and delivered at that time by His grace and power.
