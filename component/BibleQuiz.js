            The fact that the cities of refuge were not only meant for the natural Jews but also for strangers and sojourners dwelling among them has significant implications in terms of the concept of justice and mercy in ancient Israel.

In ancient times, strangers and sojourners were often marginalized and treated unfairly, and they did not have the same legal protections as natural-born citizens. However, God's command to set aside the cities of refuge for both Jews and non-Jews demonstrated his concern for justice and fairness for all people, regardless of their nationality or social status.

This meant that if a non-Jew accidentally killed someone, they could also seek refuge in one of these cities and be protected from retribution until a trial could be held to determine their guilt or innocence. This showed that God's law was not only for the benefit of the Jews but was also intended to benefit all people who lived among them.

The fact that the cities of refuge were open to both Jews and non-Jews demonstrated God's concern for justice and mercy for all people and was a reflection of his character as a just and compassionate God.`,
